Consumer protection,Complaints handling,Several/Others,243,Customer complaints resolved in the last period,"For analyses with a primary focus on financial inclusion, it is recommended that only retail customers (i.e., natural persons) and/or financial products held by these types of customers are considered.",% of customer complaints that were solved in the customers' favor in the most recent period,"This indicator shows the share of complaints closed in the reference period that were resolved in the customer’s favor. It is a direct outcome metric for fair treatment and service quality. A higher “uphold rate” can indicate strong remediation and customer-centric policies; a very low rate may suggest poor triage, overly narrow eligibility rules, or weak guidance to customers on evidence requirements. Supervisors use it to benchmark conduct outcomes across firms and products; boards track it alongside complaint volumes and resolution times to target root-cause fixes. Tracked with complaint volume, resolution time, and compensation totals, this indicator provides a balanced view of consumer outcomes and conduct risk. !- Definitions and concepts: Resolved in the customer’s favor (upheld): final decision grants redress—monetary (refund/compensation/fee reversal) or non-monetary (policy correction, contract change, apology with tangible remedy). Many firms also count partially upheld cases; disclose whether partials are included. Denominator: all complaints closed in the period (not those merely received). Segment results by product, channel, and severtiy to avoid masking problem areas. !- Data requirements: Central complaint-management records with unique IDs, receipt date, closure date, product, channel, allegation type, decision outcome (upheld/partially/declined), and compensation amount. Deduplication logic across channels; linkages to ombudsman/regulator portals for escalations and reversals. Customer-base denominator (for intensity metrics) and service level agreement (SLA) timestamps for parallel monitoring* (see note below). !- Limitations and considerations: Classification discretion: definitions of “partial uphold” vary; publish inclusion rules. Case mix effects: a surge in low-merit mass claims can depress the percentage; report severity-adjusted or line-of-business cuts. Gaming risk: chasing high uphold rates may encourage paying weak claims; pair with fraud flags, root-cause fixes, and cost-per-case. Timing bias: complex cases close later and differ in uphold propensity; use rolling averages and track median resolution time. External outcomes: include overturned-on-appeal adjustments to reflect true customer outcome. *With granular time-stamped complaints data, timeliness of key milestones in the complaints resolution process can be tracked, for example time to acknowledge complaint, time to first response, time to resolution. With this data, supervisors can track not just outcomes, but also whether providers are meeting required timeframes per their own SLA.","Financial inclusion, Microprudential supervision","Quality, Reputational and legal risk"
Consumer protection,Data privacy and protection,Several/Others,234,Consents for FSP contact,*,"% of customers who provide consent to be contacted in the future by the FSP for sales, awareness and new offerings",,Financial inclusion,Quality
Consumer protection,Data privacy and protection,Several/Others,235,Consents for sharing data with third-parties,*,"% of customers who have given explicit consent for their data to be shared by FSPs with third parties, for various purposes","This indicator shows how many customers have actively opted in to let a financial service provider (FSP) share their data with external parties—for open-banking/aggregation, credit scoring, fraud prevention, marketing, analytics, etc. A higher share can reflect strong digital adoption and trust; low or falling rates may signal poor consent UX, unclear value propositions, or privacy concerns. It helps compliance teams evidence lawfulness, product teams gauge partner-integration reach, and supervisors assess the maturity of consent-based data-sharing ecosystems. !- Definitions and concepts: Explicit consent: a clear, affirmative action (e.g., checked box, strong-customer-authenticated authorization) tied to a specific purpose, with intelligible notice and the ability to withdraw at any time. Active consent: consent that is valid as of the reference date (not expired, not withdrawn, not superseded). Purpose taxonomy: e.g., account information services (AIS), payment initiation services (PIS), credit decisioning/bureau pulls, fraud/AML tools, personalised marketing, data portability. Metric: % of customer with active consent for purpose p = [# of unique customers with at least 1 active consent for p / # of active customers] x 100%. Indicator companions: Any-purpose consent, consents per consenting customer and revocation rate. !- Data requirements: Consent ledger that includes: customer ID, purpose(s) granted, third-party identity, channel, timestamp, expiry/refresh cycle, version of the privacy notice, proof of consent (hash, audit trail, SCA event). Status events: withdrawals, expiries, scope changes, third-party disconnects. Reference universe: deduplicated active-customer list (define “active”: e.g., ≥1 product in force or ≥1 login/transaction in last 12 months). !- Limitations and considerations: Granularity & fragmentation: a customer may consent per app, per account, and per purpose; avoid double counting by using unique customers and report purpose-level cuts. Expiry & refresh: open-banking tokens often have short authorizations; snapshot dates vs. rolling windows will yield different figures—disclose method. Consumer protection risk: high opt-ins driven by coercive UX can backfire (complaints, revocations); pair with revocation rate, time-to-revocation, and complaints about data sharing. Coverage gaps: legacy channels without digital capture may under-record historical consents; backfill or disclose limitations.",Competition,Competition
Consumer protection,Data privacy and protection,Several/Others,232,Data breaches,*,% of customers affected by data breeches,"A measure of the depth of cyberattacks or other data security breach that result in unauthorized access to customer data. Definitions and concept: A data breach is any security incident in which unauthorized parties access sensitive or confidential information, including personal data (tax numbers, ID information, bank account numbers, healthcare data) and corporate data (customer records, intellectual property, financial information). Data requirement: Number of customers whose data was accessed without authorization during a specified period of time (e.g. quarter or year); Total number of customers at the beginning of the specified period (e.g. quarter or year).","Financial inclusion, Microprudential supervision","Quality, Operational risk"
Consumer protection,Depositor protection,Savings,15,Deposit accounts covered by direct deposit insurance,*,Volume and value (balances) of accounts covered by direct deposit insurance,"This indicator counts (or expresses as a percentage) the deposit accounts that fall within the scope of an explicit, statutory deposit insurance scheme (DIS) or deposit guarantee fund. It helps supervisors gauge how much of the retail/MSME funding base is protected against bank failure. This is key for financial stability monitoring, payout readiness, and for calibrating the deposit insurance/guarantee fund. High coverage supports confidence and can dampen run dynamics. !- Definitions and concepts: Covered (eligible) account: a deposit type included by law. Fully insured vs. partially insured: “Fully insured” balances are ≤ the coverage limit per depositor, per bank, per ownership category; “covered/eligible” may include accounts whose balances exceed the cap (partially insured). Ownership categories: individual, joint, trust/fiduciary, retirement—rules vary by jurisdiction and affect aggregation across accounts. Indicator variants: % Eligible accounts = eligible deposit accounts ÷ total deposit accounts. Insured balance share = insured amounts in eligible accounts ÷ total deposit balances in eligible accounts. Pass-through coverage: incomplete beneficiary data may undercount coverage. Dormancy: dormant accounts may be treated differently in coverage statistics.","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Suitability"
Consumer protection,Depositor protection,Savings,270,E-money accounts covered by pass through deposit insurance (or other),*,Volume and value (balances) of accounts covered by pass through deposit insurance,"This indicator quantifies how much of the e-money customer base is protected if the issuer's partner bank fails. It can be shown as a count or share of e-money accounts with eligible pass-through coverage, and/or the insured share of the e-money float (balances). Because most e-money models pool customer funds in safeguarded/escrow accounts at one or more banks, coverage depends on whether deposit insurance protection “passes through” to each named beneficiary (e-money customer). A higher covered share could bolster consumer confidence and limit run risk in stress events; gaps highlight operational, legal, or documentation weaknesses. !- Definitions and concepts: Pass-through deposit insurance: protection that extends from the custodian bank account to each end-user (e-money customers, who are not holders of the insured bank account). Coverage is subject to jurisdictional rules (e.g., per-beneficiary limits, record-keeping, and titling of accounts). Indicator formulas: % covered e-money accounts = eligible e-money accounts with verified pass-through protection ÷ total e-money accounts. Insured balance share = insured amounts attributable to identifiable beneficiaries (e-money customers) ÷ total e-money float. !- Data requirements: Mapping of wallet IDs to beneficiary identities and balances. Custodial banking details: account titling showing fiduciary/for-benefit-of status, participating banks, and deposit insurance scheme membership.","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Suitability"
Consumer protection,Depositor protection,Savings,16,G2P accounts covered by deposit insurance,*,% of all accounts held by G2P recipients that are covered by deposit protection,"This indicator quantifies how many of the government-to-person (G2P) payments recipients are protected by an explicit deposit insurance scheme or guarantee fund. It can be shown as (a) the share of G2P accounts that are eligible/fully insured and/or (b) the insured share of G2P balances. This indicator informs strategies for insurance/coverage payouts and the calibration of the deposit insurance fund. Definitions  and concepts: G2P account: an account that receives social transfers, government pensions, subsidies, or cash-benefit programs.
Covered (eligible) vs. fully insured: “Eligible” products fall within the deposit insurance scope; “fully insured” means the balance per beneficiary per insured bank does not exceed the coverage cap. Pass-through coverage: for pooled/“for-benefit-of” or prepaid/e-money models, insurance applies to named beneficiaries only if account titling and sub-ledger records meet scheme rules.
Indicator formulas: % eligible G2P accounts = eligible G2P accounts ÷ total G2P accounts.
% fully insured G2P accounts = accounts with balance ≤ coverage limit ÷ eligible accounts. Insured balance share = insured amounts attributable to beneficiaries ÷ total G2P balances. !- Data requirements: Beneficiary registry with unique IDs linked to bank/wallet account numbers.
Core-banking (and, where applicable, e-money) extracts: product code, ownership category, end-of-day balance, currency. Rules engine encoding national deposit-insurance scope, limits, and aggregation logic (per depositor—per bank). Sub-ledger data for pooled/FBO accounts to support pass-through eligibility. Timing sensitivity: balances spike on disbursement days; define the snapshot (e.g., month-end vs. T+2 after payout).","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Suitability"
Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Credit,284,Annual percentage rate (APR) for retail credit,*,"Average cost of borrowing money, including fees to get the loan, as a % of the loan principal (except for credit cards)","APR is the standardized annualized cost of borrowing that incorporates the contractual interest rate plus certain up-front or periodic fees required to obtain and maintain the credit. It lets consumers compare offers across lenders and products on a like-for-like basis, and helps supervisors monitor pricing fairness and market competitiveness. Unlike a simple “nominal” rate, APR reflects timing of cash flows and required charges, so it better approximates the true price of credit. !- Definitions and concepts: Installment credit APR (actuarial method): the internal rate of return (IRR) that equates the amount advanced to the borrower with the present value of all required payments (principal, interest, and included fees), expressed on an annual basis.
Revolving credit APR (cards/overdrafts): the periodic rate applied to the average daily balance, annualized (e.g., daily rate × 365 or monthly rate × 12), plus disclosure of any mandatory fees as prescribed. Scope of fees: typically includes origination/processing fees and compulsory charges; excludes penalty fees and optional add-ons (unless mandated). APR vs. EIR: APR is a consumer disclosure metric (jurisdiction-specific rules); EIR is an accounting yield used to recognize interest income.!- Data requirements: Contract terms: principal advanced, repayment schedule (dates/amounts), nominal rate, compounding frequency, and variable-rate index/margins. Included fees: origination/processing, mandatory maintenance or platform fees, financed vs. paid-in-cash. For revolving products: periodic rate(s), balance computation method (average daily balance), mandatory annual fees, grace-period rules, promotional/teaser rates.
Use a simple or weighted average (for example, using the  loan size as a weight) to estimate the typical lender or system-wide APR. !- Limitations and considerations: Jurisdictional differences: which fees are included and how revolving behavior is modeled vary (e.g., US Reg Z vs. EU APRC), hindering cross-country comparisons. Behavioral assumptions: APR for revolving credit depends on assumed utilization/repayment; real costs may differ with early payoff or persistent balances.
Promotions & step-ups: teaser or deferred-interest offers can make snapshot APRs unrepresentative—show lifetime-effective examples when possible. Variable rates: APR at origination may understate future cost if reference rates rise. Loan term effects: fixed fees loom larger on short tenors; present both APR and the fee share of cost for transparency.","Financial inclusion, Competition","Quality, Competition"
Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Credit,183,Cost to customer for retail borrowers,,Average topline revenue earned from retail credit operations (as percentage of the average outstanding unsecured credit),"This indicator is a portfolio-level proxy for the all-in price actually paid by customers on unsecured retail credit during the period. It answers: How many currency units of revenue did the lender earn for each 100 units of average unpaid balance? Rising values may reflect higher base rates, heavier fee reliance (e.g., late/over-limit charges), or a shift toward shorter-tenor/high-yield products; falling values can indicate competitive pressure, promotional pricing, or relief programs. Boards, supervisors, and consumer-protection teams use it to benchmark pricing fairness, earnings quality, and sensitivity to interest-rate cycles. !- Definitions and concepts: Recommended numerator (topline revenue, P&L-recognized): Interest income (EIR basis) + contractual fees (origination, servicing) + penalty/default interest actually recognized + punitive fees (late, over-limit, returned-payment) − waivers/reversals. Denominator: Average outstanding unsecured retail balances (use Average Daily Balance - ADB). Formula: Cost-to-customer yield = Topline revenue from unsecured retail credit divded by Average outstanding unsecured retail balances. This indicator can be reported separately for interest, contractual fees and penalities if the data is available and when the period is less than 12 months, report an annualized figure. !- Data requirements: GL and product-level revenue broken into interest, contractual fees, penalty interest, punitive fees; flags for waivers/reversals and non-accrual. Loan/card-level balances to compute ADB, segmented by product (cards, instalment, overdraft, BNPL), channel, and risk bucket. Accounting policies: EIR vs. cash, Stage-3/non-accrual treatment, capitalization rules.
FX mapping for multi-currency portfolios. !- Limitations and considerations: Comparability: EIR vs. cash accounting and non-accrual practices differ; disclose methodology. Mix effects: more revolving/short-tenor loans inflate yields; always segment. Penalty bias: high ratios may be driven by a small cohort repeatedly paying fees—track % customers incurring penalties. Promotions/teasers: intro 0% and fee holidays distort short periods—show trailing-12-month and cohort views. Scope creep: exclude bundled insurance premiums or merchant discounts (BNPL) unless consistently included and disclosed.",Financial inclusion,Quality
Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Savings,159,Cost-to-customer for transaction accounts by account type,,"Average topline revenue earned per account holder as % of average account balances, by account type","This indicator estimates the effective price of holding and using a transaction account, expressed as a yield on the customer’s average balance. By computing it for each account type (e.g., basic/no-frills, standard retail, premium, SME, e-money wallet), it reveals where pricing and usage frictions are highest. It helps supervisors assess fairness, inclusion quality, and reliance on fee income. !- Definitions and concepts: Non-interest fees: maintenance/inactivity, ATM/network, FX/transfer, statement/card fees, overdraft & returned-payment fees tied to the account. 
Per account-holder basis: aggregate all accounts of the same type per customer, then average (also show balance-weighted results). !- Data requirements: Core-banking data: customer ID, account type tags, average daily balance by customer for each account type, interest credited, revenue by fee code linked to accounts; flags for waivers/refunds/chargebacks. Channel/product hierarchies (basic vs. premium, retail vs. SME, wallet vs. bank account) and currency/FX mapping. Optional: usage indicators (transactions per month) to explain differences across types.",Financial inclusion,Quality
Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Insurance,198,Insurance approved claims not paid,*,% of approved/accepted claims that remain unpaid to customers,"This indicator shows the share of claims that have been approved (final liability accepted) but not yet disbursed to the claimant. A high rate flags operational bottlenecks or weak payout controls, directly impacting customer outcomes. Track alongside claims turnaround time, claims rejection rates, and complaints, to get a full picture of payout effectiveness and customer fairness. !- Definitions and concepts: Approved / accepted claim: a claim with a final decision to pay (post-analysis), a recorded payable, and no outstanding dispute. Unpaid status: no successful settlement to the beneficiary by period end. Formula: Amount weighted (unpaid approved amount ÷ approved amount) reveal economic impact. Count basis (# approved claims not paid by cut-off ÷ # claims approved in teh period). SLA variant: % not paid within X days of approval (e.g., 5/10/30 days) to neutralize end-period timing bias. Treatment of partial payments: disclose whether partially paid claims are counted as unpaid or excluded. The indicator may also track the reasons for non-payment, if these are standardized for reporting. !- Limitations and considerations: Cut-off effects: approvals late in the period will naturally be unpaid—use the SLA variant and report both snapshot and flow views. Reopened claims / appeals: specify whether reversals after approval are removed from both numerator and denominator. Segmentation: monitor by line of business, payment method, channel, and claim size to target fixes.","Financial inclusion, Microprudential supervision","Quality, Reputational and legal risk"
Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Insurance,256,Insurance claims declined,*,% of claims logged by policyholders that are declined prior to substantive analysis,"This indicator captures the share of claim notifications the insurer does not accept for assessment at the front door—typically during first notice of loss (FNOL)/triage—because they are clearly ineligible or incomplete. A high intake-decline rate can point to unclear policy wording, poor customer guidance, data-capture frictions, or overly strict gatekeeping. It is a key conduct-risk and customer-experience signal and, operationally, helps size avoidable workload versus genuinely assessable claims. Claim logged / FNOL: the moment a policyholder submits a claim or loss notice. Declined at intake (non-acceptance): the insurer refuses to open an assessable claim before investigation (e.g., policy not in force, peril not covered, waiting period, duplicate claim, claim below deductible/threshold, incomplete mandatory data not cured within a set window). Indicator formula (count basis): # claims declined at intake in period divided by # claim notifications received in period . Variants: exclude cured cases later resubmitted; report by product/channel. !- Data requirements: Claims-intake system fields: FNOL timestamp, policy ID/status at loss date, coverage/peril checks, deductible, mandatory-document checklist, triage outcome. Standardised reason codes (e.g., not covered, lapsed, duplicate, below excess, incomplete info). Deduplication logic (policyholder ID + incident date + peril). Linkage to resubmissions/appeals and to complaint records for outcome tracking. !- Limitations and considerations: Definition variance: what counts as “prior to analysis” differs; some firms place incomplete cases in “pending info” instead of “declined,” affecting comparability.
Gaming risk: shifting cases to “withdrawn” or “pending” to improve this metric; require audit trails and age-off rules. Mix effects: products with low deductibles or mandatory documents (e.g., health) have different baseline rates—segment results. Customer fairness: high early declines may reflect confusing onboarding or exclusion wording; monitor alongside claims rejection rate (post-assessment), turnaround time, and complaints upheld. Resubmission policy: disclose whether cured resubmissions are excluded from the numerator to avoid double counting.","Financial inclusion, Microprudential supervision","Quality, Reputational and legal risk"
Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Insurance,60,Insurance claims rejection rate,*,% of all insurance claims that are rejected by insurers (post-analysis),"The claims rejection rate shows the share of claims that an insurer declines to pay—fully or partially—relative to the total number (or value) of claims submitted in a period. Because denial directly affects customer trust, supervisors use the metric to monitor fair treatment outcomes, detect aggressive underwriting or opaque policy wording, and flag operational shortcomings. A sudden rise may presage reputational damage, regulatory sanctions, or litigation costs, while an unusually low rate can hint at lax fraud controls or inadequate claims processing. !- Definitions and concepts: Claims rejected (denied): claims for which the insurer issues a final communication refusing payment on contractual grounds (e.g., policy exclusions, lapsed cover, misrepresentation) or on fraud findings. !- Limitations and considerations: Definition divergence: Some regimes class “claims closed without payment” (due to missing documents) as rejections; others record them as pending, complicating cross-market comparison. Fraud vs. technical denial: Combining fraud rejections with contractual exclusions can blur very different issues. Separate reporting is best practice. Volume vs. value: A single large, legitimately denied loss can distort amount-based ratios; analysts should monitor both count and value metrics.
Appeals and reversals: Denials overturned on review lower true rejection rates; timely data updates are essential.
Incentive effects: Over-emphasis on low rejection rates may weaken fraud vigilance, whereas strict targets can push staff toward technical denials—pair the indicator with complaint ratios, turnaround times, and fraud-detection statistics for balanced oversight.",Financial inclusion,Quality
Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Insurance,201,Insurance claims settlement ratio,*,% of insurance claims logged by policyholders that have been paid by insurers,"Measures the percentage of insurance claims settled by an insurer out of the total claims it receives. It is a direct measure of an insurer's reliability and its commitment to fulfilling its primary promise to policyholders. This indicator is a cornerstone of conduct supervision, as it provides a quantitative view of how an insurer treats its customers at their most critical moment of need. For prudential supervisors, it could help analysis of operational and reputational risk. This indicator should be used together with other indicators on the performance of the claims process in the insurance sector.",Microprudential supervision,Reputational and legal risk
Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Insurance,59,Insurance claims turnaround time,,Average number of days to process insurance claims,"This indicator captures the average calendar days an insurer takes to settle a claim—from the claim filing date to the final payment or formal denial. It is a direct yard-stick of operational efficiency and customer experience. Shorter turnaround times (TATs) enhance policy-holder trust, limit reputational risk, and can lower claims handling expenses. Supervisors use the metric to enforce fair-treatment rules, while actuaries and underwriters link it to reserving accuracy—prolonged settlement can signal documentation bottlenecks, fraud investigations, policy transparency issues, or catastrophic complexity that may keep outstanding reserves elevated. !- Definitions and concepts:  Start point – the timestamp when the insurer first receives the claim request. End point – the date the insurer issues full payment, partial final payment, or a written denial. Average turnaround time (TAT) – arithmetic mean; many firms also monitor median and 90th-percentile to limit outlier masking.
Segmented TATs – tracked by line of business, claim severity band, and distribution channel to isolate problem areas.
!- Limitations and considerations: Partial settlements: Recording the date of first partial payment can understate full-and-final completion time. Dispute and litigation pauses: Regulatory or court‐mandated suspensions inflate TAT yet lie outside managerial control.",Financial inclusion,Quality
Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Credit,184,Late penalty charges as % of total topline revenue,,% of topline revenues that are attributable to penalities and other punitive charges earned from retail credit,"This indicator shows how much of a lender’s unsecured-credit revenue (credit cards, personal loans, overdrafts, BNPL) comes from penalties/punitive charges rather than from standard pricing. A high share can signal affordability stress and conduct-risk (fee-harvesting, opaque terms), create earnings volatility (fees fall when relief programs run), and invite supervisory scrutiny or caps. Used with delinquency and complaint metrics, it helps boards judge whether growth is sustainable and customer outcomes are fair. !- Definitions and concepts: Penalty / punitive charges (numerator): late-payment fees, over-limit fees, returned-payment/NSF fees, delinquency/default charges, collections/admin penalties, and (policy choice) the penalty-interest differential (interest above the contractual rate once in default). Topline revenue from unsecured credit (denominator): interest income (EIR basis) + fees/commissions directly attributable to unsecured products (excludes interchange on purchase volume unless you choose to include it consistently). Scope clarifiers: exclude origination/processing fees (not punitive), dispute reversals counted net, and stop-accrual rules for non-performing loans. Formula: [Penalty fees + (optional) penalty-interest differential - waviers/refunds/chargebakcs] divided by [Total unsecured-credit revenue]. !- Data requirements: General-ledger revenue by product with fee taxonomy (late, over-limit, NSF, collections, penalty interest). Loan/card-level flags linking fees to unsecured products; channel and segment tags. Adjustments for fee waivers/refunds, recoveries, and write-offs of uncollected fees. Policy notes: inclusion/exclusion of penalty interest; treatment of interchange; EIR vs. cash basis. !- Limitations and considerations: Comparability: accounting policies differ (EIR vs. cash; when penalty interest stops); disclose methodology. Regulatory caps & amnesties: changes can shift the ratio abruptly—annotate series. Mix effects: portfolios with more revolving/card exposure naturally generate more penalties than amortizing loans; segment results. Behavioural bias: high ratios may reflect small groups paying repeated fees—track share of customers incurring penalties and fees per affected account. Conduct risk: incentives to rely on penalty income can backfire (complaints, churn); pair with hardship/forbearance stats and early-arrears rates. For a fuller picture, report (a) the ratio by product, (b) customers affected (%), and (c) median fee per affected customer, alongside delinquency and write-off trends. Should FSPs not be allowed/willing to share sensitive revenue data, ratios/percentages can be performed in-house and then shared with regulator.",Financial inclusion,Quality
Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Credit,260,Late penalty charges/fees on retail credit,*,Income from penalty fees as % of total net interest income,"This indicator shows how much of a lender is relying on penalty fees to income income. The revenue with penalty fees and other charges applied when a loan payment is late is compared with the total gross interest income. A high share could signal borrower stress and potential conduct risk (reliance on punitive pricing). Boards and supervisors use the metric to assess earnings quality, pricing fairness. !- Definitions and concepts: Penalty/default fees and charges: the fees and costs charged once a loan  is past due. Numerator (preferred “incremental” view): Penalty actually recognized as income on retail loans during the period. Denominator: Gross interest income. !- Data requirements: General-ledger mapping that identifies penalty income at product level. Period interest income totals for the denominator.  Mix effects: card-heavy books show higher shares of penalty income; segment by product. Conduct lens: pair with % customers incurring penalty charges, related complaints.",Financial inclusion,Quality
Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Investments,207,Net rate of return on investments,,% point differential between the average rates of returns on investments and the average performance/administration fees charged,"Measures the profitability of a financial institution's own investment portfolio after accounting for all associated costs. It reveals the actual, bottom-line gain or loss generated by the institution's securities, real estate, or other investments. This is a fundamental indicator of an institution's ability to effectively manage its own capital and generate profit from non-lending activities, of particular importance to prudential supervisors, including supervisors of insurance and pension administrators.

Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Credit,185,Processing and application fees or PAF (as % of loan principal),*,PAF as % of loan principal in unsecured credit operations,"This indicator expresses the total up-front charges borrowers pay to originate an unsecured loan—processing fees, application fees, documentation charges—as a percentage of the loan’s principal amount. Because unsecured credit often targets price-sensitive segments and carries higher risk-based interest rates, excessive PAFs can materially raise the all-in cost of borrowing, undermine affordability tests, and trigger consumer-protection scrutiny. Tracking the ratio helps regulators detect predatory pricing, compare lenders’ transparency practices, and gauge competition in loan-origination services. For lenders, it is a barometer of non-interest revenue reliance and a lever for recouping acquisition costs. Processing & Application Fees (PAF): any non-refundable charge levied at or before disbursement for administrative tasks (credit checks, KYC, documentation, platform usage). Late-payment or insurance fees are excluded.
PAF ratio (simple): [Total PAF charged/Gross loan principal]×100%
Where multiple partial disbursements occur, use the aggregate principal amount. Annualised impact: when PAFs are capitalised into the Effective Annual Percentage Rate (APR), their weight declines as term length rises—monitor both absolute and APR-embedded views. !- Data requirements: Loan-level records capturing principal, disbursement date, PAF amount, and any rebates for cancellations. Product codes distinguishing personal instalment loans, credit-card cash advances, payday/BNPL equivalents. Borrower demographics and channel identifiers (branch, mobile app, marketplace) for segmentation. Accounting entries showing whether fees are recognised up-front (IFRS 15 “contract costs”) or amortised via the effective-interest-rate (EIR) method. !- Limitations and considerations: Amortisation differences: Lenders using EIR spread PAFs over the loan’s life; comparing ratios on a cash basis versus amortised income can mislead. Bundled products: Cross-selling (e.g., credit-life insurance) may shift income from PAF to commissions, understating the ratio. Regulatory caps & disclosures: Jurisdictions with fee ceilings or mandatory APR disclosures compress PAF ratios; cross-country benchmarking must control for such rules. Loan term effects: Short-tenor payday or BNPL loans show high PAF percentages even when absolute fees are small; interpret in context of maturity profile and APR. Waivers & promotions: Temporary fee holidays for marketing campaigns can distort time-series trends—flag promotional periods separately. Should FSPs not be allowed/willing to share sensitive revenue data, ratios/percentages can be performed in-house and then shared with regulator.",Financial inclusion,Quality

Consumer protection,Fair treatment,Credit,181,Revenue generated by unsecured credit,*,% of total topline revenue attributable to unsecured credit operations and interest and non-interest revenue proportions,"This indicator captures the total income that a lending institution earns from unsecured credit products—credit cards, personal instalment loans, overdrafts, payday and buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) facilities—over a reporting period. Because unsecured lending is typically high-yield and high-risk, tracking its revenue helps supervisors and management understand how much of the institution’s top line depends on products that are more sensitive to economic downturns, job-market shocks and aggressive competition. A rising share can boost short-term profitability, but it may also presage higher future credit losses and conduct-risk concerns if underwriting standards slip. !- Definitions and concepts: Unsecured credit – loans that are not backed by collateral; repayment relies on the borrower’s cash flow and creditworthiness.
Revenue components – Interest income (accrued and collected) from outstanding balances. Fee income: annual fees, origination fees, late-payment charges, interchange on card transactions, BNPL merchant discount rates. Net insurance or payment-protection premiums (if bundled) may be included subject to local accounting rules.
Revenue share metric: Unsecured-credit revenue ÷ Total lending revenue expresses concentration risk. Risk-adjusted yield – revenue net of credit-loss provisions gives a clearer view of economic profitability. !- Data requirements: Product-level general-ledger extracts segregating interest, fees and other income. Loan-level flags identifying collateral status (secured vs. unsecured). Average daily or month-end balances to compute effective yields. Associated credit-loss provisions and write-offs for risk-adjusted analysis. !- Limitations and considerations: Mixed products: Some personal loans are partially secured (e.g., salary-linked) or carry optional collateral; clear taxonomy is essential. Fee recognition rules: Capitalised origination fees amortised under effective-interest-rate (EIR) accounting may blur timing comparisons across banks or jurisdictions. Regulatory caps: Interest-rate or fee ceilings (e.g., usury limits) affect revenue potential and comparability. Promotional pricing: Introductory 0 % card offers or BNPL “pay-in-4” models generate deferred revenue; headline figures may understate future income. Economic cyclicality: Unsecured-credit revenue can fall sharply in recessions as balances contract and charge-offs rise; pairing with delinquency and provision metrics is crucial for a full risk-return picture.",,
Consumer protection,Impact,Credit,172,First-time borrowers,*,% of borrowers who are first-time borrowers with the FSP (or in the financial system),"This indicator shows the share of active borrowing customers who are new to the lender (new-to-bank/FSP) or new to formal credit altogether (new-to-credit, NTC). It is a direct barometer of financial inclusion and franchise growth. A higher share can signal effective onboarding and market expansion, but it also shifts portfolio risk: NTC borrowers may lack repayment histories, making underwriting more model-driven and subject to greater uncertainty. Supervisors and lenders can monitor this metric to balance inclusion objectives with prudent risk management and to evaluate the effectiveness of credit-bureau coverage. - Definitions and concepts: First-time borrower (FSP scope): a customer with no prior loan or credit line ever booked by the FSP before the reference period. First-time borrower (system scope / NTC): a customer with no prior loan or credit line reported to the national credit registry/bureau within a defined historical look-back (commonly “ever,” or a long horizon such as 5–10 years). This indicator is obtained by dividing the number of first-time borrowers by the total number of borrowers. Variants of this indicator include: value-weighted (by origination amount), new originations only (versus the entire active book), and cohort-based analysis (by origination month or quarter). !- Data requirements: Customer master records with unique, reliable identifiers (national ID/tax ID; deduplicated across branches). Loan-booking history from the FSP’s core systems. Credit-bureau/registry match results (for system-wide NTC status). Product taxonomy (include/exclude credit cards, overdrafts, BNPL) and reference dates. Limitaitons and considerations: Coverage gaps: thin or partial bureau coverage, informal lenders, or non-reporting segments can misclassify NTC status.
Identifier quality: name changes, multiple IDs, or data-entry errors cause false “first-time” flags; robust deduplication is essential. Look-back window choice: shorter windows inflate “first-time” shares; disclose methodology. Product scope: excluding revolving credit or microloans biases results.",Financial inclusion,Uptake (account ownership)
Consumer protection,Impact,Credit,175,Payroll loans,,"% of all retail borrowers (or loans) that have payroll loans (repayments deducted directly of wages deposited into the customer's account) 
","Measures the prevalence of payroll lending in the retail loan portfolio. !- Definitions and concepts: A payroll loan (also called a payroll-deducted loan, salary loan) is a personal consumer loan whose installments are automatically withheld from the borrower’s pay-check (or pension/social-security benefit) and remitted directly to the lender each pay period. Because repayment is taken “off the top” of the employee’s gross salary, the borrower’s future income effectively serves as collateral, giving lenders high repayment certainty and allowing them to charge lower rates than on unsecured personal loans. !- Data requirements:  Loan-level records with ability to identify payroll loans (e.g. product code or terms of loan that specify the repayment modality). Unique customer ID in order to extract unique number of borrowers with payroll loans.",Financial inclusion,Uptake (account ownership)
Consumer protection,Impact,Savings,163,Term deposit accounts (outstanding balance),*,Outstanding balance in term deposit accounts,"This indicator shows the average liability balance per customer who holds at least one term (time) deposit (TD) —certificates of deposit, fixed/notice deposits, etc. It gauges the depth of savings relationships, informs funding stability and pricing strategy, and helps size deposit-insurance exposure. Rising averages can reflect successful affluent-segment acquisition or rate-driven inflows; falling figures may signal disintermediation to money funds/securities or competitive pressure. !- Definitions and concepts: Term deposit accounts (such as certificates of deposit) are interest-bearing accounts whose funds can be withdrawn (without penalty) at the maturity date. Customer-level aggregation: first sum balances across all term-deposit accounts per customer, then average across customers. Average balance basis: use Average Daily Balance (ADB) over the period to avoid end-month spikes. !- Data requirements:  Core-banking extracts: customer ID (deduplicated), account numbers, product flags (term/time), currency, daily end-of-day balances, accruals credited, maturity/tenor, renewal status. FX rates to translate foreign-currency TDs to a reporting currency.  Customer segmentation variables. !- Limitations and considerations: Averages hide skew: report median and P90 alongside the mean; a few large tickets can dominate. Scope choice: “holders-only” excludes non-holders; if using “all customers,” disclose that many zeros will depress the average. Product taxonomy: clearly separate term deposits from current/savings and from wholesale/interbank placements.",Financial inclusion,Uptake (account ownership)
Consumer protection,Impact,Savings,147,Transaction accounts per customer,*,Average volume and value of transaction accounts per customer,"This indicator summarizes, at the customer level, (a) how many transaction accounts people hold on average (volume) and (b) how much money they keep in them on average (value). It’s useful for sizing relationship depth, cross-sell potential, inclusion quality (one-account vs. multi-account holders), and funding stability. Tracked over time and by segment, it highlights product mix shifts and concentration risk. !- Definitions and concepts: Transaction account: payment-capable deposit/wallet (current/checking, savings with payments, e-money wallet with bank custody); exclude escrow/trust/suspense. Customer scope: unique person/entity (deduplicated across branches/subs). Decide whether to include only holders or all customers. Metrics: Average volume = [Total number of accounts owned]/[Total number of unique account holders]; Average value (holders only) = [Sum of account balances across all accounts]/[Total number of unique account holders]. For the average value metric, using the average daily balance per customer rather than the balance at the end of the period may be preferred. !- Data requirements: Core-banking/wallet extracts: customer ID, account IDs, product/type, activation status, average daily balance (ADB) or end-of-month balances, currency. Mapping tables to consolidate legal entities; FX rates for translation. Flags for joint accounts, dormancy, and ineligible ledgers. !- Limitations and considerations: Deduplication quality (multiple IDs, name changes) affects counts.
Joint-account attribution can double-count if not standardized. E-money sub-wallets require beneficiary-level mapping to avoid overstating accounts. Seasonality (paydays, tax cycles) distorts point-in-time balances—using average daily balance or rolling means can mitigage this.

Consumer protection,"Impact, Suitability",Credit,171,Unsecured credit facilities per borrower,*,Average volume and value (outstanding amount) of unsecured credit operations per borrower,"This indicator shows, for each unsecured credit type (e.g., credit cards, personal instalment loans, overdrafts/lines, BNPL/pay-in-4, microcredit), how many active facilities the typical borrower holds (volume) and how much they owe on average (value). It reveals product stacking, utilisation intensity, and pockets of affordability risk. Rising volumes with flat values can indicate product fragmentation (e.g., multiple small BNPL plans), while high values per borrower point to concentration risk and potential loss severity. !- Definitions and concepts: Borrower universe per type (t):  unique customers with ≥1 active unsecured facility of type (t) during the period. Average volume (holders-only) = [Total number of active contracts of type t for borrow b] / [Total number of unique borrowers with facility of type t]. Average value (holders only) = [Average daily outstanding balance across all of borrower b's facility of type t] / [Total number of unique borrowers with facility of type t]. Outstanding amount: Gross carrying amount before prvisions, exclude undrawn limits. Attribution rules: Define treatment of joint borrowers (full vs. proportional), refinances/restructures and charged-off accounts (exclude once written off, unless still on-book). !- Data requirements: Loan/line-level records with borrower ID, product/credit-type tag, status, origination date, limit (revolving), currency, and daily balances. Deduped customer master across subsidiaries/channels; joint-borrower flags. FX rates for multi-currency portfolios; calendar to compute ADB over the period. !- Limitations and considerations: Seasonality: cards/overdrafts spike around holidays—use ADB and rolling windows. Mix effects: comparing cards (revolving) with instalments needs a utilisation companion metric. Policy choices: inclusion of dormant but open lines, re-aged accounts, or post-charge-off recoveries changes results—document choices. Distribution matters: report median and percentiles per type alongside means to avoid high-balance skew.","Financial inclusion, Microprudential supervision","Outcomes, Credit risk"

Consistent monitoring also reveals control weaknesses, helping authorities direct enforcement, bolster preventive regulation, and keep the payments and deposit system trusted and resilient. This indicator measures the share of customers of financial services that have been victims of fraud over a specific period. !- Definitions and concepts: Several definitions of fraud exist and vary depending on the jurisdiction, local definitions of fraud for statistical reporting purposes should be used. For example, the European Banking Authority splits fraudelent payment transactions into two categories: (1) Unauthorised payment transactions: transfers made “as a result of the loss, theft or misappropriation of sensitive payment data or a payment instrument … executed in the absence of consent by the payer.” and (2) Manipulation of the payer: transactions “made as a result of the payer being manipulated … to issue a payment order … in good faith, to a payment account it believes belongs to a legitimate payee.” This definition anchors EU-wide fraud statistics and stresses both technical compromise (e.g., stolen credentials) and social-engineering scams (e.g., authorised push-payment fraud). !- Data requirements: Transactions initiated and executed during a specified period that are flagged as fraudulent linked to a unique customer ID; Total number of customer at the beginning of the specified period.",Financial inclusion,Quality

Consumer protection,Suitability,Several/Others,158,Balance in inactive and dormant accounts,*,% of total transaction account balances that are held in inactive and dormant accounts,"This indicator shows the share of funds sitting in deposit deposit/ transaction (checking/current accounts that are not actively used by customers. High concentrations of idle balances can signal weak customer engagement, poor product fit, or frictions in account usage—important for financial-inclusion quality, liquidity management, and conduct risk. From a prudential angle, large dormant balances may look “stable” but can reverse if reactivation drives or policy changes prompt withdrawals. For consumer protection, persistent dormancy raises risks around unclaimed funds, fees, and fraud.  Definitions and concepts: Transaction accounts: demand/current accounts and other payment-capable deposit accounts. Inactive account: no customer-initiated debit/credit (card use, cash withdrawal/deposit, transfer) for a defined window (e.g., ≥90 or 180 days). System entries (interest, fees, bank corrections) don’t count. Dormant account: extended inactivity beyond a longer threshold (commonly ≥12 months) that may trigger special handling (restricted access, outreach, escheatment). Indicator formula: Balances in inactive + dormant transaction accounts divided by total transaction-account balances. Reporting the split (inactive vs. dormant) can provide further detail. !- Data requirements: Core-banking ledger with end-of-day balances, product codes, and last customer-initiated activity timestamp per account. Classification rules reflecting local definitions (inactive/dormant thresholds; treatment of standing orders/auto-debits). Ownership segment (retail/SME), currency, and insured/uninsured flags. Optional: outreach attempts, reactivation outcomes, and fee assessments to monitor conduct risk. Limitations & considerations: Definition divergence: thresholds and what counts as “activity” vary by jurisdiction and even by institution—state methodology clearly. Data quality: some channels (agents, fintech front-ends) may not update the core “last activity” field, overstating dormancy.
Seasonality & cycles: balances can spike around payroll/tax periods; use consistent month-end or averages. Policy effects: dormancy fees, auto-closures, and unclaimed-funds rules materially affect trends.

Consumer protection,Suitability,Credit,190,Borrowers in debt counselling and rehabilitation,*,% of borrowers participating in debt counselling and/or debt rehabilitation progams,"This indicator tracks the prevalence of individuals formally enrolled in debt-counselling or rehabilitation programmes: legal or contractual processes that restructure debt, impose spending plans, or provide financial-literacy support. A rising level signals household over-indebtedness pressures, tighter monetary or labour-market conditions, or aggressive credit expansion in the recent past. Regulators, consumer-protection agencies, and lenders track the metric to gauge systemic consumer-credit risk, calibrate responsible-lending rules and supervision, and anticipate write-off or provisioning needs. !- Definitions and concepts: Borrowers refers to individuals that have obtained any type of credit from financial institutions. Individuals are counted as one borrower, irrespective of the number of loan accounts held. Debt-counselling / debt-review: A court-sanctioned or regulator-approved process (e.g., South Africa’s National Credit Act, UK Debt Management Plans) where a certified counsellor assesses affordability, negotiates new payment schedules with all creditors, and disburses consolidated instalments. Debt rehabilitation / discharge: The stage at which the borrower has completed the plan, obtained a clearance certificate, or been legally discharged from remaining obligations (analogous to Chapter 13 completion in the US). Indicator forms:
Stock measure: number of active borrowers under counselling ÷ total number of retail borrowers. Flow measure: new counselling entrants during the period ÷ new defaults. !- Data requirements: Registry or court filings identifying unique borrowers, start and end dates, original and restructured debt balances, and counsellor accreditation. Credit-bureau data to link counselling status with credit scores, delinquency buckets, and new credit enquiries. !- Limitations and considerations: Coverage gaps: Informal or NGO-led advice services may not report centrally, understating prevalence. Regime differences: Some jurisdictions treat insolvency, debt management, and bankruptcy as separate processes; harmonising counts is non-trivial. Multiple enrolments: Borrowers can exit and re-enter counselling; deduplicating unique individuals is essential for accurate stock figures. Moral-hazard concerns: Easy access to rehabilitation might weaken repayment discipline; analysts pair this indicator with post-rehabilitation re-default rates.Privacy restrictions: Personally identifiable data are often masked, limiting segmentation by income, gender, or geography unless aggregated extracts are provided. Used alongside delinquency trends, restructuring volumes, and loan-loss provisions, the “borrowers in debt counselling and rehabilitation” metric offers a forward-looking lens on household financial stress and the effectiveness of consumer-protection frameworks.","Financial inclusion, Microprudential supervision","Outcomes, Credit risk"
Consumer protection,Suitability,Credit,27,Borrowers in risky indebtedness (risk of over-indebtedness),*,"Number of borrowers classified as at risk of over-indebtedness, as per risk-indebtedness calculation","Tracking over-indebtedness gives authorities a measure of systemic distress: when large segments of retail borrowers can’t meet their obligations, it highlights consumer-protection gaps. Persistent debt burdens signal predatory lending or inadequate affordability assessments. The indicator helps calibrate market-conduct supervision and regulation. This particular indicator that identifies borrowers at risk of overindebtedness was developed by the Central Bank of Brazil: https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/cidadaniafinanceira/documentos_cidadania/serie_cidadania/serie_cidadania_financeira_8_endividamento_risco_2ed.pdf ad https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376634051_Risky_Indebtedness_Behavior_Impacts_on_Financial_Preparation_for_Retirement_and_Perceived_Financial_Well-Being. It is a composite of four components. A borrower is flagged as being in ""risky indebtedness"" when any two of the following four criteria are met: (1) Has defaulted on credit installments, that is, has had payment delays of more than 90 days in meeting credit obligations, (2) Monthly income devoted to debt-service payments exceeds 50 percent, (3) Has simultaneous exposure to the following forms of credit: overdraft, unsecured personal loan, and revolving credit card debt, (4) Monthly disposable income (after debt-service payments) that falls below the poverty line. Generating this indicator at the system level requires a unique national ID in order to match granular loan data to unique borrowers. The indicator also requires access to income data. !- Derivable indicators: Percent of borrowers in risky indebtendess; Percent of adults in risky indebtedness.",Microprudential supervision,Credit risk
Consumer protection,Suitability,Payments,211,Cash transactions (volume),*,Number of cash transactions,"An aggregate measure of the use of cash as a means of exchange in the economy. On a per capita basis, this indicator is a measure of the intensity of cash transactions and is useful to track the use for cash over time. Analysis of cash transactions by account type (transaction, deposit, savings, mobile money) or institutional type (e.g. Commercial banks, Credit unions and cooperatives, MFIs) is recommended. !- Definitions and concepts: Cash transactions include physical currency or cash-equivalent deposits into any account through any channel (ATM, branch, agent) and cash withdrawals through any channel. !- Data requirements: Total number of cash deposits and cash withdrawals over a specified period (e.g. quarter) separately for all relevant channels and account types; total population (from recent census or estimates from national statistics agency). !- Derivable indicators: Cash transactions per capita; Cash transactions per transaction account holder; Average number of cash transactions per day/month/quarter; Average number of cash transactions per day/month/quarter per transaction account holder.",Central banking,Currency management and cash handling
Consumer protection,Suitability,Credit,285,Debt service-to-income ratio,*,% of income allocated to retail credit debt repayment,"The debt service-to-Income ratio,  sometimes referred to more concisely as the debt service ratio (DSR) expresses a borrower’s (or household’s) total debt-service burden relative to recurring income, answering a simple question: How much of each income unit is already pledged to repay existing debt? At the micro level, lenders use DSR to assess repayment capacity, price credit, and comply with responsible-lending rules. At the macro level, supervisors track average or distributional DSR to gauge household vulnerability to interest-rate shocks and to calibrate macro-prudential tools such as loan-to-income caps. !- Definitions and concepts: Debt payments include principal, interest, mandatory insurance on retail credit facilities;  Income can be defined in gross terms (pre-tax income (salary) plus verifiable recurring earning) or net terms (income after taxes and social-security contributions). !- Data requirements: Current loan statements or credit-bureau/registry reports detailing payment amounts, remaiming term, and interest rate for all obligations; Recent payslips, audited financial statements (self-fmployed), tax returns, and verified rental or pension income. !- Limitations and considerations: Income volatility: informal or gig-economy or commission-based earnings make future cash flows uncertain; Undisclosed liabilities: informal or unreported debts escape bureau coverage, understating true DSR. Household composition: shared living expenses and co-borrower support can distort individual ratios; some frameworks use household disposable income instead. Interest-rate path: fixed-rate loans keep payments stable, while floating-rate debt can raise DSR sharply when policy rates rise. Cross-country comparability: tax structures, social-welfare benefits, and healthcare costs influence disposable income, so identical DSR thresholds may imply different real affordability across jurisdictions.","Financial inclusion, Microprudential supervision","Quality, Credit risk"
Consumer protection,Suitability,Credit,152,Deposit account holders qualifying for credit,*,% of all deposit account holders that meet the minimum qualifying criteria for a loan or line of credit,"A measure of the assessed creditworthiness of depositors. Digital financial tools such as mobile money and e-wallets have opened up access to financal services to millions around the world. This indicator tries to measure the degree to which users of accounts can unlock access to addiitonal services, in the case credit. !- Definitions and concepts: Deposit accounts include transaction and non-transaction deposit accounts, for example: Checking/demand, savings, time/term deposit accounts, pensions. !- Data requirements: Total number of unique deposit account holders that also either have (1) an open loan account, (2) do not have an open loan account but would be approved for a loan or line of credit given their current credit history, credit score or other basic requirements (such as minimum balance or savings history); Total number of unique deposit account holders (i.e. an individual must be counted as one depositor irrespective of the number of deposit accounts held) at the end of a specified period (e.g. quarter or year).  !- Limitations and considerations: If individuals or MSMEs own deposit accounts across multiple different financial institutions, sector or system wide aggregates which add up accounts across institutions will, as a result, overstate the degree of financial inclusion unless granular data and unique national IDs can be used to identify individuals with multiple accounts across financial institutions.","Financial inclusion, Microprudential supervision","Outcomes, Credit risk"
Consumer protection,Suitability,Credit,176,Early loan payoff,*,% of borrowers who paid loans in full before due date,"The early-loan-payoff (or prepayment) indicator tracks the share of outstanding loans that borrowers settle—partly or fully—before the contractually scheduled maturity. High prepayment activity can squeeze interest income, change expected cash-flow profiles that underpin asset-liability management, and distort credit-loss models. For lenders, rising early payoffs may flag aggressive refinancing campaigns by competitors, interest rate declines that make refinancing attractive, or borrowers’ improved liquidity. Supervisors and investors monitor the metric to evaluate revenue volatility, among others. !- Definitions and concepts: Early payoff / prepayment: any unscheduled principal reduction exceeding the contractual amortisation, including full settlement (loan closed) and partial prepayments (lump-sum curtailments).",Financial inclusion,Outcomes
Consumer protection,Suitability,Credit,189,Grace period/payment leeway,*,"% of borrowers using payment holidays, grace periods and other relief measures","Shows how many borrowers are under temporary repayment relief, signalling household stress, policy effectiveness, and potential payment cliffs when relief ends. Rising usage can reduce near-term delinquencies but may defer (not eliminate) credit risk and revenue. !- Definitions and concepts: Relief measures (forbearance): payment holiday/deferral, interest-only period, reduced instalment, term extension, fee/penalty waiver, capitalization of arrears, hardship programs.Borrower-based indicator: % of borrowers on relief = [Total unique borrowers with at least 1 active relief measure in period]/[Total unique active borrowing customers] x 100%. Account-based variant uses loan count instead of borrowers. Status: Active (relief in effect), Approved but not started, Expired. Intensity companions: % of balances under relief, avg. relief days used, new entrants to relief ÷ active borrowers. !- Data requirements: Loan-level flags: relief type, start/end dates, approval date, terms (interest accrual, capitalization), reason code (income loss, disaster, medical), product type. Borrower ID (deduplicated across products/entities). !- Limitations and considerations: Definition variance: some programs auto-enrol; others require hardship evidence—harmful to cross-bank comparisons. Double counting: a borrower may receive multiple reliefs across loans—use borrower-level dedupe and report per-loan as a companion. Masking effect: relief suppresses DPD/NPL temporarily; pair with balances under relief and post-exit performance. Cohort effects & timing: shocks (e.g., disasters) create spikes; use cohort tracking (by approval month) and rolling windows. Conduct risk: prolonged or opaque relief terms can mislead customers; monitor complaints and repeat relief rates.

Consumer protection,Suitability,Several/Others,155,Inactivity ratios of accounts by tenure bands and account type,*,% of all transaction accounts in each tenure band that are inactive,"This indicator shows, for each account-tenure band (how long the account has been open) and account type (e.g., basic, standard, premium, SME, e-money), the share of accounts that are inactive. It distinguishes onboarding issues (early inactivity) from long-run disengagement and helps target product, pricing, and outreach fixes. It also informs inclusion-quality reporting and assesses the sustainability of “account opening” drives. !- Definitions and concepts: Transaction account: demand/current or other payment-capable deposit/wallet. Inactive account: no customer-initiated debit or credit within a defined window (e.g., ≥90 or ≥180 days). System posts (interest, fees, bank corrections) don’t count. Tenure: time from activation date to the reference date; use consistent bands (e.g., <3m, 3–6m, 6–12m, 12–24m, >24m). Indicator (per band × type): [# inactive accounts in band, type divided by #  total accounts in band, type] ×100%. Variants: dormant ratio (≥12 months), balance-weighted inactivity share, and customer-level view (unique holders). Data requirements Core-banking/wallet extract: account ID, account type, activation date, last customer-initiated activity timestamp, ownership segment (retail/SME), currency, status. Clear activity rules (treat standing orders/auto-debits consistently). Deduplication for merged systems; exclusion flags for escrow/trust/suspense. Optional: channel, geography, product fees to explain differences. Limitations  and considerations: Definition divergence: inactivity window and what counts as “activity” vary—publish methodology. Mix & timing effects: new-account surges inflate early-tenure inactivity; use cohort views alongside calendar snapshots.

Consumer protection,Suitability,Insurance,197,Reinstatement of lapsed insurance policies,*,% of lapsed insurance policies that have been re-instated after customer made back-payments,"This indicator shows the share of policies that lapsed for non-payment and were later reinstated after the customer cleared arrears (and, where required, satisfied evidence-of-insurability). A higher reinstatement rate can indicate effective retention outreach and product value to customers; very low rates may signal affordability stress, weak follow-up, or poor customer experience. From a risk perspective, reinstatements affect cash flows, reserve dynamics, and anti-selection (customers may reinstate when risk has increased). Pair this indicator with persistency, tenure of cancellations, and complaint metrics to diagnose retention quality and customer outcomes. !- Definitions and concepts: Lapse (non-payment): policy terminated after the grace period due to unpaid premium (distinct from surrender, maturity, or death). Reinstatement: restoration of coverage after lapse once back-premiums (and any interest/fees) are paid and underwriting/administrative conditions are met. Coverage may be backdated or resume prospectively per policy terms. Measurement window: define a fixed look-back (e.g., reinstated within 90/180 days of lapse). Formula (cohort basis): # policies that lapsed in period and were reinstated within {days} divided by the # policies that lapsed in period. Variants: policyholder-level (deduplicated), premium-weighted share, and calendar-period “reinstatements ÷ lapses” with a stated window. !- Data requirements: Policy-level: product/LOB, activation date, lapse date, grace-period end, arrears amount, reinstatement date, back-payment amount, underwriting outcome (medical/financial), and whether coverage backdated. Channel, geography, tenure at lapse, and prior claims/loan status. Cohort tags (issue or lapse month) for like-for-like tracking. !- Limitations and considerations: Window sensitivity: longer window raises the rate; disclose and keep constant. Classification noise: grace-period statuses mis-tagged as lapses depress apparent reinstatement. Anti-selection: reinstated policies may have higher subsequent claims—monitor post-reinstatement loss experience. Operational variance: some firms “rewrite” new policies rather than reinstate, understating the metric. Coverage basis: backdated vs. prospective reinstatement changes exposure and reserve treatment—report the split if material.",Financial inclusion,Quality
Consumer protection,Suitability,Several/Others,161,Revenue from inactive and dormant accounts,*,Average non-interest revenue earned on inactive and dormant accounts per account holder,"This indicator estimates how much fee income a provider earns, on average, from customers whose transaction accounts are inactive or dormant. It highlights potential conduct-risk hotspots (“junk fees”), tests whether inclusion policies translate into active use, and helps gauge earnings reliance on non-usage charges. Regulators often scrutinize such revenue because it may disproportionately affect vulnerable or low-balance customers and can conflict with fair-treatment principles or local dormancy rules. Used alongside % balances in inactive/dormant accounts, reactivation rates, and complaints upheld about fees, this metric provides a balanced view of inclusion quality and earnings fairness. !- Definitions and concepts: Inactive account: no customer-initiated transaction over a defined window (e.g., ≥90/180 days). Dormant account: extended inactivity (e.g., ≥12 months) triggering special handling (restricted access, outreach, or escheatment). Non-interest revenue: maintenance/inactivity fees, SMS/statement charges, card fees, ATM/network fees, account closure fees—exclude interest, FX spreads, and lending-related fees. Metric (per holder): Avg. fee per inactive/dormant holder = [Non interest fees charged to inactive+dormant accounts in period (net of waivers/refunds)] divided by unique customers with ≥1 inactive or dormant account in period. Report per-account as a companion view, and show inactive vs dormant separately. !- Data requirements: Core-banking extracts: account status, last customer-initiated activity timestamp, balances, product code. General-ledger fee income by fee code with identifiers to tie fees to specific accounts/customers; flags for waivers/refunds/chargebacks. Customer master data to deduplicate holders with multiple accounts. Policy tables: inactivity/dormancy thresholds, fee schedules, and escheatment rules; time-at-risk (days classified as inactive/dormant). !- Limitations and considerations: Definition variance: thresholds and what counts as “activity” differ—state methodology. Partial-period bias: accounts turning dormant late in the period face fewer fee days; consider normalizing by days inactive/dormant. Outliers & distribution: averages can be skewed; also report median, 90th percentile, and % of affected customers. Conduct/regulatory constraints: some jurisdictions cap or ban dormancy fees or require fee cessation before escheatment—track compliance and annotate series breaks after rule changes.

Consumer protection,Suitability,Insurance,196,Surrendered insurance policies,*,% of eligible insurance policies (or policyholders) de-activated/lapsed that paid-out surrender values,"This indicator shows the share of terminated policies that generated a cash surrender payout. It helps distinguish benign expiries or non-cash lapses from value-bearing exits that can strain liquidity, depress embedded value, and signal product-fit or conduct issues (e.g., early surrenders after aggressive sales). Supervisors and boards use it to gauge customer outcomes, the health of savings-type books, and potential mis-selling or affordability problems. !- Definitions and concepts: Eligible policy: contracts with a cash value (e.g., whole life, endowment, unit-linked). Pure risk covers (term, many GI lines) are ineligible. Surrender vs. lapse: a surrender pays cash value on termination; a lapse ends cover without payout. De-activatd here excludes natural maturaties and deaths. Full vs. partial surrender: count full surrenders tied to termination; report partial withdrawals separately unless they trigger de-activation.
Indicator (count basis): Policies terminated in period with a surrender payout divided by the number of eligible policies terminated (non-maturity) in period. Variants: policyholder-based (unique customers), and amount-based (surrender amounts ÷ cash values of terminated policies). Segment by tenure (<1y, 1–3y, >3y), product, and channel. Data requirements
Policy-level: product type, activation date, termination date, termination reason, eligibility flag, sum assured/premium basis, accumulated cash value. Payout records: surrender amount, charges/penalties, payment date, partial-withdrawal flags. Linkages for policyholder-level deduplication and channel identification (agent, bancassurance, direct). Cohort tags (issue year/quarter) for like-for-like comparisons. !- Limitations and considerations: Scope errors: misclassifying ineligible policies or counting maturities/death claims inflates the ratio. Early-tenure bias & charges: lock-ins and surrender penalties may suppress payouts despite cancellations—an outcome worth reporting separately. Reinstatements & policy loans: define treatment; loan offsets can reduce observed payout without changing customer exit.
Data granularity: partial withdrawals that don’t terminate cover should be excluded or separately disclosed. Conduct lens: high early-tenure surrender shares point to mis-selling or affordability issues—pair with complaints, persistency, and tenure-of-cancellation indicators.",Financial inclusion,Quality
Consumer protection,Suitability,Insurance,195,Tenure of cancelled insurance policies,*,"Average time between policy activation and cancellation, by chosen time periods (e.g., <3 months, 3-6 months, 6-12 months, etc)","This indicator captures how long policies stay in force before they are cancelled (or lapse mid-term). A concentration of early-tenure cancellations is a red flag for mis-selling, poor onboarding, pricing/friction issues, or product-fit problems. It also matters for economics: early lapses strand acquisition costs, depress embedded value, and erode persistency. Tracking tenure by product and channel helps target remediation (e.g., agent training, cooling-off disclosures, claim-time communications). !- Definitions and concepts: Cancellation: termination of cover before the natural renewal/expiry date—may be customer-initiated (voluntary), insurer-initiated (non-payment, underwriting, fraud), or regulatory. Activation (policy start): the in-force date (not the issue date, if different). Tenure (days/months) = cancellation date – activation date.
Buckets: choose stable, business-meaningful bands (e.g., <3m, 3–6m, 6–12m, 12–24m, >24m). Report count-weighted and premium-weighted shares. Scope: life and non-life; clarify whether non-renewals at anniversary are counted (usually not) and how cooling-off/free-look rescissions are treated (often reported separately). Data requirements Policy-level fields: policy ID, product/LOB, distribution channel, activation date, cancellation date, cancellation reason code, written premium/sum assured, payment mode, and claim history. Status logic to exclude simple expiries and to de-duplicate reinstated policies (see below). Calendar and cohort views (by issue month/quarter) to remove seasonality. !- Limitations and considerations: Selection bias: averaging only cancelled policies ignores still-active ones. For a fuller view of lifetime behaviour, complement with survival analysis (e.g., Kaplan–Meier) and standard persistency ratios (13/25/61-month). Reinstatements: define whether a reinstated policy’s earlier cancellation is (a) ignored, (b) treated as a separate episode, or (c) measured to the first cancellation only.
Reason codes matter: split results (voluntary, non-payment, underwriting, fraud). Early non-payment suggests billing/channel issues; early voluntary points to product fit. Channel & product mix: bancassurance, digital, and agency books have distinct early-tenure profiles—always segment.

Elevated downgrade activity can signal affordability stress, product misfit, or competitive pressure (customers trading down to cheaper plans). It affects revenue (lower premiums), risk mix (higher deductibles shift loss ratios), and persistency (downgrades may precede lapses or surrenders). Supervisors and boards use the metric to monitor customer outcomes and pricing adequacy, and to gauge the effectiveness of retention strategies that preserve cover while easing budgets. !- Definitions and concepts: Downgrade (customer-initiated): a mid-term endorsement or renewal change that reduces coverage level—e.g., lower sum assured/benefit limits, higher deductibles/co-pays, downgrade of plan tier. Formula (count basis): # policies with customer-requested downgrades in period divided by # active (or renewing) policies in period. !- Limitations and considerations: Multiple events: the same policy may downgrade more than once—decide event vs. policy-unique counting.

This indicator intends to capture more directly the incremental demand-for and provision of loans during the most recent period.  !- Definitions and concepts: Borrowers refers to resident individuals or MSMEs that have obtained any type of credit from financial institutions. Individuals or MSMEs are counted as one borrower, irrespective of the number of loan accounts held. !- Data requirements: Unique borrowers who opened at least one loan account during the most recent specific period (e.g. month, quarter or year.), including borrowers whose loan was subsequently closed at the end of the period. For computing borrowers per capita or percent of adults that borrow from financial institutions, need total adult population (official count from census or estimates from national statistics agency). !- Limitations and considerations: If individuals are using loans from multiple financial institutions,  sector or system-wide aggregates, may count the same borrower more than once and therefore overstate the number of unique borrowers unless a unique national ID can be used to track individual borrowers across institutions.","Consumer protection, Microprudential supervision","Impact, Credit risk"

Financial inclusion,Usage,Savings,340,Deposit accounts (outstanding balance),*,Value (outstanding balances) of deposit accounts,"This indicator totals the outstanding balances—principal plus accrued but unpaid interest—across all active deposit accounts held at regulated financial institutions at a given reporting date. The figure reveals the size of the banking system’s core funding base, the stock of household and MSME sector savings, and the portion of the money supply sitting in deposit form among these sectors. A rising balance can reflect healthy income growth, successful financial-inclusion efforts, flight-to-safety behaviour, or accommodative monetary policy; a sharp decline may foreshadow liquidity stress, disintermediation into higher-yield instruments, or confidence shocks. Supervisors track the metric to test funding-gap ratios, calibrate deposit-insurance funds, and monitor the transmission of interest-rate moves to retail savers. !- Definitions and concepts: Outstanding balance: book value of customer liabilities on the reporting date, including accrued interest but excluding yet-to-post interest for the current period. Deposit types: demand/current, savings, time/fixed-term, notice, and negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts. Some jurisdictions also include e-money float ring-fenced in banks. Gross vs. net of reserve requirements: analyses should specify whether statutory reserve deductions have been netted out. Segmentation: resident vs. non-resident, retail vs. wholesale, insured vs. uninsured—each slice carries different run-off characteristics in a stress scenario. !- Data requirements: End-of-day core-banking ledger extracts with account number, product code, currency, balance, and customer sector.

Historical time series to assess growth trends and seasonality. !- Limitations and considerations: 4 Multiple counting: interbank placements and pass-through agent balances can inflate totals if not stripped out. FX volatility: large foreign-currency books can distort trends when exchange rates swing; constant-currency views help. Dormant or legally blocked funds: balances in frozen or deceased-estate accounts add to the stock but are not immediately withdrawable.

Market development,Capital markets development,Investments,45,Crowdfunding - Differential rate of return (equity),,Difference between the advertised/promised rate of return and the actual rate of return of equity in crowdfunding projects,"Measures the gap between the projected or advertised rate of return presented to investors before a project is funded and the actual rate of return realized after the project is completed. This is a critical conduct indicator that measures the accuracy of a project's promises versus its real-world performance. For investors, this metric is a tool for due diligence. For conduct supervisors, it can be used to detect mis-selling and fraud. A large and persistent negative differential (where actual returns are consistently far below promised returns) is a red flag. it could flag issues such as inadequate risk disclosure and fraud. When gender disaggregated by the gender of the main sponsor or lead executive, the indicator can provide additional information. If projects led by women consistently show a smaller negative ""reality gap"" (meaning their actual returns are closer to their promised returns), it could suggest they are more conservative or accurate in their financial projections. This would be a crucial data point in assessing risk and investor protection. Using this indicator together with the indicator on rejected crowddfunding projects could strenghten the identification of gender bias inside the securities authority.

Market development,Capital markets development,Investments,43,Crowdfunding - Success rate,,% of all crowfunding projects that are successful in raising the asked amount,"The indicator is a metric that measures the proportion of projects on a crowdfunding platform (or the sum of all crowdfunding platforms) that successfully reach their predetermined funding goal within a specified timeframe. This indicator is a vital sign of a platform's effectiveness, credibility, and the overall health of its ecosystem. It helps gauge the ability of a platform to connect viable projects with interested backers. For MSMEs, crowdfunding can be a viable and less onerous funding source, so the indicator provids important information for monitoring development of MSME finance markets. From a market conduct perspective, while a high success rate is generally positive, an unusually high or artificially inflated rate could be a red flag for misconduct. Platforms could be setting trivially low funding goals to boost statistics,  failing to conduct proper due diligence on projects, or not being transparent about how the success rate is calculated.

It focuses on fees directly tied to the closure process (not ongoing usage fees). High averages or wide dispersion can signal unfair fee structures, poor process design (e.g., costly payout rails), or weak disclosures—issues that draw conduct-risk scrutiny and harm inclusion goals. Tracking this metric alongside complaints upheld about closure, time to close, and payout failure/return rates gives a rounded view of off-boarding fairness and efficiency. !- Definitions and concepts: Transaction accounts are broadly defined as an account held with a bank or other authorised and/or regulated service provider (including a non-bank) which can be used to make and receive payments. Transaction accounts can be further differentiated into deposit transaction accounts and e-money accounts. Customer-paid closure charges: amounts debited to the customer because of closure, including: explicit closure fees, final statement/document fees, card/cheque deactivation fees, balance-refund/payout charges (e.g., wire/RTGS, cheque issuance, e-money cash-out), account package early-termination fees, statutory taxes/levies linked to these items, and FX/transfer margins if required to remit funds. Exclusions: regular monthly maintenance already charged prior to the closure request, penalty interest on unrelated lending, and third-party fees not passed through. !- Data requirements: Event log with closure request date and closure completion date; customer ID (deduplicated), number of accounts closed, channel, reason code. Transaction-level fee taxonomy to flag closure-related charges; payout transactions (method, amount, fees, FX). Reversal/waiver flags and timestamps to net back rescinded charges.

'Active' closure of an account refers to cases where the closure is initiated at the request of the customer, and not due to inactivity or dormancy. !- Data requirements: List of unique deposit account holders (i.e. an individual  must be counted as one depositor irrespective of the number of deposit accounts held) who actively close any of their accounts over a specified period of time (e.g. quarter or year); Total number of unique depositors at the beginning of the specified period.",,
Market development,Competition,Several/Others,267,Interest rate spreads (loans),*,Difference between the average lending rate and a reference rate (e.g. deposit rate or external reference rate),"The interest-rate spread on loans captures the margin between the average contractual rate a lender charges borrowers and an external reference rate—typically the policy rate. It is a concise gauge of (i) lenders’ credit-risk pricing, (ii) competitive conditions in the lending market, and (iii) monetary-policy transmission. Wider spreads may reflect higher perceived borrower risk, limited competition, or funding-cost pressures; persistently narrow spreads can point to aggressive underwriting or excess liquidity that may undermine future asset quality. Tracked over time and across peer institutions, interest-rate spreads provide insights into credit-cycle turning points, profitability dynamics, and the effectiveness of monetary-policy signals reaching the real economy. !- Definitions and concepts:  Loan interest rate spread (simple): Average contractual loan rate minus Reference rate measured for new originations or for the stock of loans. Net lending spread: average loan rate minus average deposit rate, often used when policy benchmarks are volatile. Segmented spreads: calculated by product (e.g., mortgages, SMEs, credit cards).

A higher share signals trust, clear value propositions, and mature consent customer interfaces (mobile apps); a low or falling rate may reflect friction in UX or Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), poor messaging, or privacy concerns. It’s a headline adoption KPI for open finance schemes. !- Definitions and concepts: Explicit consent: a clear, affirmative action tied to a specific purpose with the ability to manage and withdraw. Active consent: valid as of the reference date (not expired/withdrawn). Open finance consenting customers (%) = [# unique customers with at least 1 open finance consent / # eligible customers] x 100%. Denominator options: all active retail/MSME customers (preferred) or customers with eligible accounts (state choice). Segment by purpose of consent, scope (accounts included), and channel (mobile/web). Duplication & scope: a customer may hold multiple consents across TPPs; count unique customers, and compare with total count of consents.

High availability is critical for data users such as third-party providers (TPPs) to deliver reliable account information and payment initiation; poor uptime breaks customer journeys, breaches SLAs/SLOs, and can trigger regulatory scrutiny in open finance schemes. !- Definitions and concepts: Availability (uptime):  time-weighted share of intervals in which an endpoint meets both reachability and success criteria. Scope — include account information service, payment initiation service, consent/token endpoints, and webhooks if they’re required for completion. Planned vs. unplanned:  exclude planned maintenance time; report maintenance windows separately. SLO period: availability is usually measured monthly/quarterly (e.g., 99.9% per calendar month), but preferably in shorter periods (e.g., weekly, daily). Granularity: overall availability, by endpoint family, region/zone, and time of day. Example indicator: Availability = 1 - [Downtime / Total scheduled time] where Downtime aggregates intervals failing the success criterion (5xx gateway/network timeouts, auth outages, or latency breaches). !- Limitations and considerations: Including latency SLOs will lower availability vs. status-only measurements.

Faster responses improve user experience during consent, account-information retrieval, and payment initiation, reducing frictions and drop-offs. Response time is a core performance KPI that complements availability and error rate. !- Definitions and concepts: Response time (latency): elapsed time between request start and final byte received (client-observed) or gateway in → gateway out (server-observed). Track both when possible. Averages vs. tails: report p50/median, p95, p99, and the mean; tails (p95/p99) best reflect user pain. Track both.

It’s a core adoption and usage KPI for Payment Initiation Services (PIS): more transactions imply growing merchant and P2P acceptance of openb finance, customer trust, and TPP–bank interoperability. !- Definitions and concepts: Payment initiation transaction (PIT): a payment order created via an authorized PISP/TPP and accepted by the ASPSP (account holder) for processing. Companion counts: Failed payment initiation transactions. Refunds/returns/chargebacks tracked separately. Sub-types: single immediate payments, scheduled payments, recurring/VRP (variable recurring payments), instant vs. ACH/batch. !- Data requirements: Total number of successful payment initiation transactions. !- Limitations and considerations: Duplicates: avoid double counting by using operation IDs.",,
Market development,Competition,Several/Others,32,Product portability requests,*,Number of product portability requests,"Measures the volume of formal requests initiated by customers to transfer their financial product or relationship from one provider to another within a specific period. This includes activities like switching a mortgage, transferring a loan to a new lender, or moving a current account to a new bank. This indicator is a gauge of market competition, consumer empowerment, and potential frictions or risks within the financial system. Very low switching rates can indicate significant barriers to entry or anti-competitive behavior, suggesting that customers are ""trapped"" with their current providers due to high exit fees, complex processes, or a lack of clear alternatives. This indicator is even more important in countries where product switching platforms or open finance exist and whose effectiveness should be monitored. A companion indicator to the total number of product switch requests is the total number of switches effected in the period, in comparison to the total number of requests. Another companion indicator is the total number of requests (or successful requests) relative to the number of active customers. The central bank of Brazil has calculated the number of loan portability requests relative to the number of loans with an interest rate above the market average rates, using the number of loans with above-market interest rates as a proxy for the untapped potential of the portability system. https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/publicacoes/Documents/reb/boxesreb2020/boxe_2_evolucao_portabilidade_credito_brasil.pdf","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Fair treatment"
Market development,Competition,Several/Others,33,Rejected product portability requests,*,% of all product portability requests that are rejected,"Measures the volume of formal portability requests initiated by customers to transfer their financial product or relationship from one provider to another within a specific period, which are rejected by the financial service provider. Product portability includes activities like switching a mortgage, transferring a loan to a new lender, or moving a current account to a new bank. This indicator is a gauge of market competition, consumer empowerment, and potential frictions or risks within the financial system. Very low switching rates can indicate significant barriers to entry or anti-competitive behavior, suggesting that customers are ""trapped"" with their current providers due to high exit fees, complex processes, or a lack of clear alternatives. This indicator is even more important in countries where product switching platforms or open finance exist and whose effectiveness should be monitored. When providers reject too many portability requests, this could be a sign of anti-competitive practices. This indicator should be analyzed together with the indicator on the total number of portability requests.","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Fair treatment"
Prudential supervision,AML/CFT,Several/Others,64,Suspicious transaction reports,*,Number of suspicious transaction reports,"The indicator tallies the suspicious transaction reports (STRs)  financial service providers file with the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) when they suspect financial crimes such as money-laundering and terrorism financing. A rising count can signal stronger transaction monitoring systems or higher level of potentially criminal activities. Policymakers use STR volumes, in combination with other data (e.g., investigations), to allocate investigative resources. !- Definitions and concepts: Suspicious Transaction Report (STR): a mandatory report filed when a transaction is known, suspected, or has reasonable grounds to be suspected of involving criminal proceeds or terrorist funds (FATF Rec. 20). Reporting entities: broadly, all institutions covered by the AML/CFT law, including all finacial financial service providers. !- Data requirements: FIU registry of incoming STRs, ideally tagged by date, reporting institution, sector, transaction channel, predicate crime category, and outcome (e.g., disseminated to law-enforcement), and customer gender. Data quality: Duplicate submissions, incomplete narratives, or vague suspicion reasons hamper analysis and inflate reported numbers without real value. Confidentiality constraints: Detailed STR data including customer gender may be restricted.",,
Prudential supervision,AML/CFT,Several/Others,65,Systematic reporting to financial intelligence unit/office (FIU),*,Number of transactions reported (excluding suspicious transaction reports) to FIU,"This indicator counts all objective anti-money-laundering (AML) disclosures that reporting institutions file with the FIU other than Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs)—for example Cash / Large-Value Transaction Reports (CTRs/LCTRs), Cross-Border Currency Reports (CBCRs), Electronic Funds Transfer Reports (EFTIs), and threshold-based filings. Tracking the volume highlights how much potentially risky activity flows through the regulated system, tests the reach and effectiveness of automated monitoring engines, and helps the FIU size analytical workloads and allocate investigative resources. When combined with STR counts and outcome statistics, this indicator offers a comprehensive perspective on the preventive arm of the AML/CFT framework. !- Definitions and concepts: Objective reports: filings triggered automatically when a transaction exceeds a statutory threshold or meets a predefined typology—irrespective of suspicion. Thresholds are set at national level and vary across countries. Reporting entities: all AML-obliged financial institutions. Optional denominator metrics to enable intensity ratios: total transactions processed or number of active customers. !- Data requirements: FIU registry of objective-report filings with unique identifiers. Data-quality variance: Missing customer identifiers or incorrect codes hinder FIU analytics; robust validation routines are essential.",,
Prudential supervision,Credit risk,Credit,24,Delinquency rate in the retail loan portfolio,*,Volume and value of delinquent retail loans as a proportion of total retail portfolio,"The delinquency rate tracks the share of consumer loans—mortgages, credit-cards, instalment loans, auto, buy-now-pay-later, qualifying MSMEs—that have fallen past due but have not yet crossed the “non-performing” threshold or been written off. Rising early-stage arrears are an early-warning signal of household stress and of future spikes in non-performing loans (NPLs), provisions and write-offs. Paired with NPL, restructuring and write-off metrics, the delinquency rate provides a forward-looking barometer of retail credit health. Supervisors and risk managers use the metric to test the effectiveness of underwriting standards, consumer disclosure, customer interfaces (for digital loans), and pricing for credit risk. !- Definitions and concepts: Loan delinquency refers to a situation in which borrowed money is not paid back as agreed. A loan becomes delinquent when a borrower misses a regular installment payment. A delinquent loan is any kind of loan that has past due payments but has yet to go into default. On a value basis, this indicator measures the total outstanding balances past due (for example greater than 1 day past due) as a share of gross retail loan balances at the end of a specified period. Operational cut-offs: Inconsistent days past due calculation (calendar days vs. business days, partial payments) hinders cross-lender comparability.","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Suitability"
Prudential supervision,Credit risk,Credit,26,Gender composition of loan guarantors,*,Gender composition of guarantors in the retail loan portfolio,"Measures the representation of different genders among the individuals who act as loan guarantors--pledge to repay a loan if the borrower defaults. It offers a sophisticated lens through which to view credit risk, gender-based economic disparities, and the social dynamics that underpin a loan portfolio. It can reveal hidden concentration risks. For example, if a large portion of a bank's small business loans are guaranteed by the male spouses of female entrepreneurs, the portfolio's risk profile becomes heavily correlated with the financial health and stability of that specific demographic.  This metric also provides insights into the structural barriers different genders face when seeking credit. If the data shows that female borrowers disproportionately require male guarantors (while the reverse is not true), it can signal underlying biases in credit assessment or a disparity in asset ownership. Prudential supervisors may also be interested in finding out whether the different permutations of borrower's and guarantor's gender could relate to loan performance. Conduct supervisors would use it to scrutinize lending practices for fairness and equity.",Consumer protection,Fair treatment
Prudential supervision,Credit risk,Credit,118,Large exposures,,Large exposures as % of total capital,"Tracks a lender's credit exposures to single counterparties or groups that exceed a threshold (e.g., a % of capital) and ensures none breach the regulatory cap. !- Definitions and concepts: Exposure includes on- and off-balance-sheet items. !- Data requirements: Counterparty-level exposure data, eligible capital base.",,
Prudential supervision,Credit risk,Credit,22,Non performing loans (NPLs) in the retail portfolio,*,Non performing loans rate in the retail loan portfolio,"The NPL indicator for the retail loan portfolio quantifies the share (or absolute value) of consumer and MSME loans that are unlikely to be fully repaid. Because retail credit typically involves high volumes of granular, often unsecured exposures, a build-up of NPLs signals mounting credit risk costs, pressure on provisioning, and potential stress. Supervisors track this metric to assess lenders' underwriting standards, resilience to economic shocks, and the effectiveness of arrears management. !- Definitions and concepts: An NPL is defined as a loan that is past-due for a minimum amount of days (e.g., 90 days). The definition can vary across countries but the Basel Committee has set common standards. The retail portfolio encompasses exposures to individuals and qualifying MSMEs treated under the retail asset class. The most common ratio is Gross NPLs ÷ Gross retail loans. Aggressive charge-offs or “evergreening” can temporarily lower the NPL ratio without improving underlying asset quality. Seasonality and relief measures: Payment holidays or pandemic moratoria may defer delinquencies, masking latent credit risk.","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection, Macroprudential supervision","Quality, Suitability, Stability"
Prudential supervision,Credit risk,Credit,125,Physical risk in the credit portfolio,*,Exposure of the credit portfolio to customers/industries with high physical risk related to climate change,"This indicator quantifies how much of the loan book is exposed to climate-related physical risks, specifically. These risks materialize through direct damage to assets, disruptions in business operations, or negative impacts on local economies, all of which can lead to higher rates of loan defaults and losses for the lender. This indicator should complement the all-encompassing indicator that measures climate-related risks (both physical and transition risks). Definitions and concepts of climate-related risks vary across countries. The Basel Committee has defined climate-related financial risks, including physical risks, while the NGFS provides a range of additional defintions, including nature-related financial risks.",,
Prudential supervision,Credit risk,Credit,111,Restructured loans,*,Volume and value of restructured loans as a proportion of total retail portfolio,"The restructured loans indicator tracks the portion of a lender's credit portfolio whose contractual terms have been modified to relieve a borrower in financial difficulty—by lowering the interest rate, extending maturity, granting grace periods, converting currency, or partially forgiving principal, or a mix of these. A rising stock signals mounting credit stress, latent loss risk, or even internal frauds or mismagement. While restructurings can help viable borrowers bridge a temporary shock, they may defer recognition of non-performing loans (NPLs). Supervisors watch both the level and the flow of restructurings to detect “ever-greening”. !- Definitions and concepts: Restructured (or renegotiated / forborne) loan: an exposure whose cash-flow terms have been modified for credit risk reasons and would not have been granted under comparable market conditions. Local definitions vary, while standard setting bodies such as the Basel Committe and IFRS have provided common standards. Indicator formula: Restructured loans ÷ Gross loans (stock measure). !- Limitations and considerations: Regulatory divergence: Some jurisdictions treat any concession as a restructuring; others exclude purely administrative changes, hampering cross-country comparisons. Forbearance episodes: Crisis-era moratoria or government-mandated payment holidays may inflate restructuring volumes temporarily, masking true borrower weakness. Portfolio mix effects: High-yield consumer portfolios often show higher restructuring rates than collateralised mortgages; segment analysis is essential.","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Suitability"
Prudential supervision,"Credit risk, Solvency",Credit,262,Write offs ratio (retail loans),,Volume and value of written off retail loans as a proportion of total retail portfolio,"The write-offs ratio tracks the portion of the retail loan portfolio that a lender permanently removes from its balance sheet within a period because collection is deemed impossible or uneconomic. It is a forward-looking credit-risk barometer: rising write-offs shrink the loan book, erode earnings through higher impairment charges, and may reveal weaknesses in underwriting or collections. Supervisors examine the indicator alongside NPL and provisioning coverage to judge whether lenders are recognising losses promptly or postponing them through restructurings. !- Definitions and concepts: Write-offs ratio is usually expressed as (Gross retail loan write-offs during period ÷ Average gross retail loans outstanding). Write-off: an accounting action that derecognises the unrecoverable portion of a loan’s amortised cost. It does not preclude further collections, which are recognised as recoveries. !- Limitations and considerations:  Timing disparities: Institutions with aggressive 180-day charge-off policies show higher ratios than peers that delay write-offs until legal exhaustion, complicating comparisons..","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Suitability"

Prudential supervision,"Market risk, Liquidity risk",Credit,120,Property to capital ratio,,Exposure to property,"The property to capital ratio compares an entity's aggregate exposure to the real estate sector with the shock-absorbing capital. Over-exposure to real state investments could wipe out a large share of the institution’s capital in case of falling prices, or could indicate speculative investment by lenders. Used in trend and peer analysis, the property-to-capital ratio provides an early warning of over-exposure to real-estate investments and informs both micro-prudential and macro-prudential policy actions. Supervisors therefore use the metric to spot excessive exposure to real state that is not justified by core lending activities (e.g., repossed foreclosed properties). !- Definitions and concepts:  Property exposure: the on-balance-sheet book value of residential and commercial real-estate investment. Capital: usually Common Equity or Total Regulatory Capital. Ratio formula: Total property exposure ÷ Capital × 100 %.",Statistics & research,Statistics & research
Prudential supervision,Operational risk,Several/Others,31,Balance of suspense accounts,,Value of balances of suspense accounts,"Suspense deposit accounts are temporary holding ledgers used when a transaction cannot be posted to its final customer account because critical details are missing or disputed or due to any technical issues. The balance of suspense accounts aggregates the outstanding debit or credit amounts awaiting resolution. Persistently high or growing balances signal weaknesses in reconciliation, client on-boarding, Know-Your-Customer (KYC) data quality, payment-processing controls, or even internal fraud. Ageing buckets: some regulators require ageing of reported balances (0-30, 31-90, 91-180, >180 days) to identify balances that exceed tolerance windows. !- Limitations and considerations: Accounting practices vary: some institutions clear items by moving them to internal “parking” accounts that may not be labelled suspense, understating the indicator. Standardization is needed to ensure reporting of balances in similar accounts that are not labelled ""suspense accounts"". Regulatory treatment: in certain jurisdictions, long-dated unresolved credits are treated as unclaimed funds.","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Safety and security"
Prudential supervision,Operational risk,Several/Others,29,Incomplete/failed transactions,,% of all initiated transactions that are incomplete or failed,"Measures the percentage of transactions that users initiate but that do not successfully complete as intended. It's a metric for assessing the reliability, usability, and accessibility of a digital financial service. A high rate of incomplete or failed transactions points to a poor user experience, and may lead to financial loss if funds are temporarily held and not returned. A sudden spike in this indicator can be an early warning of technical problems, cybersecurity attacks, or capacity issues. Incomplete transactions: transactions that are started by the user but are never fully processed to a conclusion. They are often ""timed out"" or abandoned. Failed transactions: transactions that are fully processed by the system but are ultimately rejected. The system actively returns an error message confirming the failure.","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Safety and security"
Prudential supervision,Operational risk,Several/Others,106,Operational disruption incidents,,Number of operational disruption incidents,"This indicator counts and classifies events that interrupt an institution’s ability to deliver financial services—whether due to IT failures, cyber-attacks, power outages, third-party breakdowns, or physical events (e.g., fire, pandemic lockdowns). Regulators track both the frequency and severity (e.g., service-unavailable minutes, customers affected, monetary losses) to judge the resilience of regulated services. A rising trend can erode confidence and expose the system to contagion if multiple firms rely on the same outsourced providers or infrastructure.
!- Definitions and concepts: Operational disruption incident: an unplanned event that prevents or materially degrades the delivery of a critical business service beyond a defined tolerance. Definitions, including of critical services, vary across countries. Standard setting bodies including the Basel Committee provide standardized definitions that can be used. 
Impact metrics: duration, peak concurrent users affected, transaction backlog, financial loss, data-integrity impact, customer detriment, others. Root-cause categories: hardware/software failure, cyber-intrusion, third-party outage, human error, environmental event, others. !- Limitations and considerations: Firms may fear reputational damage so there is a risk of under-reporting. Heterogeneous critical-service definitions may be used across firm, so regulatory standardization is needed.","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Safety and security"
Prudential supervision,Operational risk,Several/Others,107,Successful cyber attacks,,Number of successful cyber attacks,"A measure of the frequency of cyberattacks on regulated financial institutions over a specified period. !- Definitions and concepts: A cyberattack is any intentional effort to steal, expose, alter, disable, or destroy data, applications, or other assets through unauthorized access to a network, computer system or digital device. Cyberattacks can disrupt and damage businesses and often carry high costs, including the costs of discovering and responding to the violation, downtime and lost revenue, and the long-term reputational damage to a business and its brand.

Prudential supervision,Solvency,Insurance,122,Cost of reinsurance,,Premiums ceded to reinsurers as % of gross premium written,"The cost of reinsurance indicator quantifies the price an insurer pays to transfer part of its underwriting risk to reinsurers. Tracked as either an absolute expense or as a ratio—most often Reinsurance premium ceded ÷ Gross premiums written (GPW)—it shows how much earnings capacity the insurer surrenders for balance-sheet protection. Rising costs may stem from hardening global reinsurance markets, high catastrophe exposures, deteriorating loss experience or weakened credit quality of the insurer. Supervisors and rating agencies watch for excessive reliance on expensive reinsurance cover which can compress margins, while under-spending may leave the insurer over-exposed to shocks. Evaluated over time and in tandem with retention ratios, claims ratio and solvency coverage, the cost of reinsurance reveals whether an insurer’s risk transfer strategy is adequate. !- Definitions and concepts: Reinsurance premium ceded: contractual payments (net of commissions) made to reinsurers for proportional (quota-share, surplus) or non-proportional (excess-of-loss, stop-loss) treaties, booked at treaty inception. Net cost of reinsurance: ceded premium minus ceding commission plus profit-commission adjustments and reinstatement premiums. Timing mismatches: Premiums are typically paid up-front, while recoveries occur post-loss, so annual cost ratios can spike in growth years and dip after large events.",,
Prudential supervision,Solvency,Insurance,56,Insurance claims (loss) ratio,,% of total premium income paid out as claims,"The claims paid ratio compares the amount of benefits and claims an insurer actually disburses during a period with the premium income it records for the same portfolio. It answers a basic question for supervisors, policy-holders, and analysts: How much of each premium dollar flows back to customers in the form of claims? Persistently low ratios may flag overly aggressive pricing, onerous exclusions, or servicing bottlenecks, while very high ratios can foreshadow reserve inadequacy, under-pricing, or a spike in catastrophe losses. In combination with the expense ratio, the indicator feeds into the overall loss or combined ratio that underpins solvency and profitability assessments. !- Definitions and concepts: Claims paid: cash actually settled with policy-holders and claimants in the accounting period, including partial payments and salvage recoveries netted where local GAAP allows. It excludes outstanding claims reserves and IBNR, which are captured by “claims incurred.” Gross vs. net basis: gross claims ignore reinsurance recoveries; net claims deduct them, better reflecting the insurer’s retained risk. Segmented ratios (e.g., motor, health, property) pinpoint product-level profitability. !- Data requirements: Extracts from the claims-management system showing paid amounts, dates, line of business, and reinsurance cessions. Premium registers (written or earned, depending on supervisory preference) reconciled to the general ledger. Catastrophe tags, legal-settlement flags, and large-loss registers to isolate one-off distortions. Limitations & considerations: Timing mismatch: annual premiums are often received up-front, whereas claim payments can lag; using earned premiums mitigates, but does not eliminate, this distortion. Claims-handling practices: delayed settlement or dispute escalation depresses the ratio without improving true risk experience. Reinsurance structure: quota-share vs. excess-of-loss treaties change the net ratio dramatically; analysts should review both gross and net perspectives. Regulatory definitions: some jurisdictions fold surrenders of savings-type contracts into claims, inflating comparability. Trend analysis should therefore pair the claims paid ratio with claims-incurred and reserve-adequacy metrics, catastrophe-loss disclosures, and expense dynamics to obtain a holistic view of underwriting performance and solvency resilience.","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Suitability"
Prudential supervision,Solvency,Insurance,8,Insurance claims incurred,,Value of insurance claims incurred by the insurance sector,"“Claims incurred” represents the total cost an insurer recognises for claims events during a reporting period, regardless of whether they have been paid yet. Tracking the level and trend of incurred claims helps supervisors monitor the financial health of insurers such as by detecting emerging risk clusters (e.g., climate-driven catastrophes). !- Definitions and concepts: Claims incurred = Claims paid + Change in outstanding claims reserves + Change in IBNR (incurred-but-not-reported) reserves ± Claims-handling expense reserve movements. !- Data requirements: Total claims incurred.  !- Limitations and considerations: Catastrophe volatility: Single severe events cause spikes. Used alongside premium growth, claims-ratio components, and reserve-adequacy studies, “claims incurred” provides a cornerstone view of underwriting performance and balance-sheet resilience.","Financial inclusion, Statistics & research","Uptake (account ownership), Statistics & research"
Prudential supervision,Solvency,Insurance,57,Insurance policy renewal (persistency) ratio,,% of all policies up for renewal that are renewed,"The renewal- or persistency-ratio gauges the proportion of in-force insurance policies (or premium) that remain active after a specified period—typically the 13th, 25th, or 61st month following issuance. High persistency signals strong customer satisfaction, effective servicing, and accurate underwriting assumptions; it underpins stable cash-flow projections, lowers acquisition-cost amortisation strain, and enhances embedded value. Conversely, rapid lapses may expose product-design weaknesses or mis-selling. Supervisors review persistency alongside surrender-value payouts and complaint levels to detect conduct risk and solvency concerns. !- Definitions and concepts: Persistency ratio (policy-count basis) = Policies renewed at month t / Policies eligible for renewal at month t
Premium-weighted persistency uses renewal premium divided by original premium to capture face-amount shifts. Cohort vs. calendar method: Cohort traces a single issue-year block through time; calendar aggregates all cohorts renewing in a given period. !- Limitations and considerations: Measurement horizon: 13-month persistency suits annual-premium life products; short-tailed general-insurance policies need annual or shorter retention ratios. Channel mix: Bancassurance and digital pathways often show different lapse behaviours—segment analysis is essential.","Financial inclusion, Consumer protection","Quality, Suitability"
Prudential supervision,Solvency,Insurance,127,Physical risk in the insurance portfolio,,Exposure of the insurance portfolio to written policies to physical risk related to climate change,"Metric used to quantify an insurer's financial exposure to losses caused by the direct physical impacts of climate change. This includes both event-driven acute risks and longer-term chronic risks. This indicator is essential for measuring an insurer's vulnerability to climate-related claims, which can impact its profitability, solvency, and ability to provide affordable coverage. Hence, it is an important metric for prudential supervisors from the perspective of capital adequacy, solvency and risk management. Definitions and concepts of climate-related risks vary across countries. The NGFS provides a range of additional defintions, including nature-related financial risks.",,
Prudential supervision,Solvency,Insurance,114,Risk retention ratio (dependency on reinsurance),,% of gross written premium that is net (as a measure of the level of dependency on reinsurance),"Also known as the net retention ratio, this indicator shows the proportion of insurance risk an insurer keeps on its own balance sheet after ceding portions to reinsurers. It is usually expressed as Net premiums written ÷ Gross premiums written. A high ratio signals greater self-reliance (and potentially higher earnings volatility), while a low ratio points to heavy dependence on reinsurance, which may reduce earnings swings but create counter-party risks. Supervisors monitor the metric to ensure that ceded volumes are commensurate with the insurer’s capital strength, product mix, and risk appetite. !- Definitions and concepts: Gross premiums written (GPW): Total premium income before reinsurance ceded. Net premiums written (NPW): GPW minus premiums ceded plus reinsurance recoveries on ceded unearned premiums. !- Data requirements: Line-of-business breakdown of GPW and NPW for the period.

Adequate provisions are the cornerstone of insurance solvency and a key indicator for prudential supervisors. Definitions & concepts: Technical provisions comprise two main blocks: Best-Estimate Liabilities (BEL), the probability-weighted expected value of future cash flows (claims, benefits, expenses) discounted using risk-free or prescribed curves; and Risk Margins, an additional amount reflecting the cost of holding capital to run off the liabilities (Solvency II) or a prudential margin (IFRS 17, LAT).",,

Prudential supervision,Soundness,Several/Others,112,Efficiency ratio,,Effciency ratio,"Indicates operating efficiency by comparing non-interest expenses to operating income. Lower ratios signal better cost control, a key driver of sustainable profitability, especially in low-margin environments. Definitions & concepts – Efficiency Ratio = Operating expenses ÷ (Net interest income + Non-interest income). Some variants exclude litigation or restructuring charges. !- Data requirements: Detailed income statement with breakdowns of personnel, IT, and occupancy costs; segment reporting helps pinpoint inefficiencies. !- Limitations and considerations: Cost cuts that impair risk management or customer service may improve the ratio temporarily but raise long-run risks. Cross-country comparisons should adjust for labour cost levels and digitalisation stages. One-off income (e.g., asset sales) can distort the denominator.",,
Prudential supervision,Soundness,Insurance,7,Insurance premiums written,,Value of insurance premiums writen in the insurance sector,"Premiums written represent the contractual revenue an insurer books when it underwrites new or renewal policies during a given period, irrespective of when coverage is provided or cash is received.

Prudential supervision,Stability,Savings,17,Deposit stability/volatility,,"Stability/volatility of retail deposits (deposit stickness, deposit stability, deposit flows)","The deposit stability (or deposit-volatility) indicator assesses how predictable a bank’s funding base is by tracking the fluctuation and “stickiness” of customer deposits over time. Sudden, correlated outflows—whether triggered by market rumours, rate competition or digital bank runs—can force a bank to liquidate assets at fire-sale prices or draw on emergency facilities. Prudential supervisors monitor deposit volatility alongside liquidity ratios to judge an institution’s ability to withstand funding shocks and to calibrate run-off assumptions in stress tests and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). Definitions & concepts: Core / stable deposits: retail balances judged unlikely to flee under stress; often defined by balance size, relationship depth, and whether the account is transactional rather than rate-sensitive. Volatility metrics: standard deviation of daily balances divided by the mean (coefficient of variation), maximum one-day net outflow over a look-back window, or elasticity (beta) to market rates. Calculation methods vary across countries. !- Data requirements: High-frequency (daily or intraday) deposit-balance time series, tagged by customer type, product, and currency. Interest-rate history to estimate betas. Customer identifiers for relationship tenure, cross-selling, and concentration analysis. 
Digital channel dynamics: mobile app withdrawals can accelerate run speed beyond historical norms; backward-looking volatility measures may understate future risk.",Microprudential supervision,Liquidity risk
Prudential supervision,Stability,Credit,6,Financial system credit operations,,Volume and value of credit operations in the total financial sector portfolio,"This indicator captures the breadth of formal lending with two perspectives: the number of credit contracts (volume) and their aggregate outstanding balance (value) across all regulated lenders. Tracking it offers a panoramic view of credit provision, enabling supervisors to (i) gauge financial deepening, (ii) assess systemic leverage of the banking sector, (iii) monitor shifts in portfolio composition (e.g., rise of consumer or MSME lending), and (iv) feed macro-prudential stress tests and monetary policy models. Sharp expansions may indicate rapid financial inclusion or overheating; contractions can herald credit crunches that dampen growth. !- Definitions and concepts: Credit operation – any legally binding loan, line of credit, hire-purchase, lease, or other. Off-balance-sheet commitments (e.g., undrawn credit lines, guarantees) are usually excluded or reported separately. Volume (count): unique credit contracts outstanding at the reporting date; renewals/extensions count as new operations if a fresh contract is signed. Segmentation by sector (household, corporate, government), product type, currency, and residual maturity enriches analysis. !- Data requirements: Supervisory returns or call-reports detailing credit operations contract count by institution and product. Standardised product and sector taxononies to avoid double counting.","Statistics & research, Consumer protection, Microprudential supervision","Statistics & research, Impact, Credit risk"

Sustainability,Gender equality,Several/Others,11,Gender diversity at FSP (by reference workforce group),,"Gender composition of FSP workforce by level of responsibility (Board, management, staff)","Measure used to assess the representation of different genders within a financial institution. It serves as a critical tool for evaluating a firm's commitment to inclusivity and is increasingly correlated with enhanced financial performance, risk management, and innovation. This indicator is not a single metric but a suite of measurements that can be applied across various levels of an organization. Ideally, it would be calculated at the board level, the senior management level (C suite), and the staff level. In some occasions, it can also be useful to calculate it for specific roles within the financial institution, such as branch managers, or agents, when analyzing differences in performance related to specific issues, such as consumer protection and conduct issues. In addition to being useful to monitor diversity at the system level, and its alignment with national gender equality policies, this indicator can also be used by prudential and conduct supervisors, as a growing body of knowledge points to improved financial and conduct performance of financial institutions that have a greater level of diversity. For prudential supervisors, this indicator serves as a valuable proxy for assessing a firm's health, as greater gender diversity is often correlated with stronger corporate governance, more prudent risk management, and enhanced financial stability.","Financial inclusion, Competition, Statistics & research, Consumer protection, Microprudential supervision, Financial safety net, Central banking, Macroprudential supervision, Capital markets development","Currency management and cash handling, Statistics & research, Stability, Credit risk, Market risk, Operational risk, Liquidity risk, Solvency, Soundness, Reputational and legal risk, AML/CFT, Competition, Capital markets development, Climate and environmental objectives, Gender equality, Data privacy and protection, Fair treatment, Complaints handling, Safety and security, Suitability, Impact, Transparency, Access, Uptake (account ownership), Usage, Quality, Outcomes, Depositor protection"

Typically calculated to spot differences across men and women, but it could be expanded to include other genders. It's typically expressed as a percentage of the higher earner gender (usually men's earnings), for a given role or hierarchical level at the financial institution. Prudential supervisors can use this indicator with a focus on the safety and soundness of financial institutions. A significant gender pay gap can be an indicator of underlying governance and operational risks. for conduct supervisors, a significant gender pay gap could be an indication of potential misconduct and unfairness that could affect customers.

Consumer protection,Complaints handling,Several/Others,239,Customer complaints (number),*,"Number of customer complaints (including processing status, channels, type)","This indicator tallies the formal expressions of dissatisfaction that retail or MSME clients lodge with a financial-service provider (or an external ombudsman) about products, services, or staff conduct over a specified period and can be normalized by dividing by the customer basis to obtain an intensity metric (e.g. complains per 1,000 active customers). A rising complaint count can signal service-quality gaps, mis-selling, opaque fees, or inadequate disclosure—issues that erode trust and may escalate into regulatory sanctions or litigation. Supervisors can track both the absolute number and complaint-to-account ratios to test consumer-protection frameworks, prioritise thematic reviews, and assess whether rapid product roll-outs (e.g., digital lending, mobile wallets) are being matched by robust after-sales support. Where granular data or more detailed reporting templates permit, customer complaints can be disaggregated by processing status (e.g. open, in-process, resolved, rejected), product (e.g. consumer loan, deposit account, etc), channel (e.g. digital, phone, in-person), issue category (e.g. fraudulent or unauthorized transactions, unfair treatment, unexpected fees, errors on statements,  etc.), closure status (open, resolved with monetary compensation, resolved without compensation, excalated to ombudsman/regulator, withdrwan) or resolution status (e.g. favorably solved vs. rejected). Combined with resolution-time, compensation and other metrics, the number of customer complaints provides a critical, early-warning lens on conduct risk and customer-experience health. !- Definitions and concepts:  Complaints are expressions of dissatisfaction by (or on behalf of) customers that are related to their experiences with FSPs and can include any written, digital or recorded verbal statement made through any available channel, such as a branch, call-centre, email, social media, chatbots and other portals. Complaints may relate to the quality of a product or service, treatment by an FSP (including its agents and other third parties), or suspected wrongdoing. Complaints are different from general inquiries (e.g., where can I find an ATM?) or legal disputes between parties that may require formal dispute resolution. For more information, see for example CGAP's toolkit on using complaints data for market conduct supervision: https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/market-monitoring-tool-analysis-complaints-data and the Alliance for Financial Inclusion's framework on 'Complaint handling in Central Banks': https://www.afi-global.org/sites/default/files/publications/2020-04/AFI_CEMC_framework_AW_digital%20v2.pdf. !- Data requirements:  Database or log of customer complaints, detailing date of complaint and additional information, such as channel through which complaint was lodged, associated product or account, details or brief description of the complaint, and resolution status. !- Limitations and considerations: Complaints processes differ across FSPs in terms of steps/levels for routing, hand-over, escalations to higher management levels and to external ombudsman. Customer details and demographics of complainants are not always capture/stored on FSPs' systems, or may be stored in fragmented data bases. Complaints logged at aggregator sites/portals may not request customer demographics. Limited to officially logged complaints and/or maintaining records of inbound customer communications. Dependent on having electronic complaints management system.  Reporting culture: firms with easy‐to‐use channels may record more complaints than peers, even if service quality is similar—benchmark using severity and uphold rates. Under-reporting bias: vulnerable customers may forgo formal complaints; mystery-shopping and survey data can complement administrative counts. Duplicate cases: the same issue voiced through multiple channels can inflate totals unless robust deduplication exists. Product mix effects: complaint propensity varies—e.g., complex investments draw more grievances than basic savings; segment analysis is essential. Regulatory divergence: definitions and mandatory reporting thresholds differ across jurisdictions, complicating cross-border comparisons.","Financial inclusion, Microprudential supervision","Quality, Reputational and legal risk"
