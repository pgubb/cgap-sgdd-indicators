172,73,First-time borrowers,% of borrowers who are first-time borrowers with the FSP (or in the financial system),"This indicator shows the share of active borrowing customers who are new to the lender (new-to-bank/FSP) or new to formal credit altogether (new-to-credit, NTC). It is a direct barometer of financial inclusion and franchise growth. A higher share can signal effective onboarding and market expansion, but it also shifts portfolio risk: NTC borrowers may lack repayment histories, making underwriting more model-driven and subject to greater uncertainty. Supervisors and lenders can monitor this metric to balance inclusion objectives with prudent risk management and to evaluate the effectiveness of credit-bureau coverage. Definitions and concepts: First-time borrower (FSP scope): a customer with no prior loan or credit line ever booked by the FSP before the reference period. First-time borrower (system scope / NTC): a customer with no prior loan or credit line reported to the national credit registry/bureau within a defined historical look-back (commonly “ever,” or a long horizon such as 5–10 years). This indicator is obtained by dividing the number of first-time borrowers by the total number of borrowers. Variants of this indicator include: value-weighted (by origination amount), new originations only (versus the entire active book), and cohort-based analysis (by origination month or quarter). Data requirements: Customer master records with unique, reliable identifiers (national ID/tax ID; deduplicated across branches). Loan-booking history from the FSP’s core systems. Credit-bureau/registry match results (for system-wide NTC status). Product taxonomy (include/exclude credit cards, overdrafts, BNPL) and reference dates. Limitaitons and considerations: Coverage gaps: thin or partial bureau coverage, informal lenders, or non-reporting segments can misclassify NTC status.
Identifier quality: name changes, multiple IDs, or data-entry errors cause false “first-time” flags; robust deduplication is essential. Look-back window choice: shorter windows inflate “first-time” shares; disclose methodology. Product scope: excluding revolving credit or microloans biases results.

21,75,Green/sustainable loans,% of all loans labelled as green or sustainable,"This indicator shows the share of a regulated lender’s aggregate loan book that is formally designated green, social, sustainability or sustainability-linked. A higher percentage signals that credit is being channelled toward activities aligned with climate-transition and inclusive-growth objectives, helping regulators gauge progress against national or international sustainable-finance targets and identify institutions with elevated exposure to taxonomy-related reputation or compliance risks. The percentage of green/sustainable loans remains a core barometer of how rapidly credit portfolios are pivoting toward environmentally and socially beneficial activities, and a leading input for green-asset-ratio disclosures and climate-stress-testing frameworks. Definitions and concepts: Green / sustainable loan: a facility whose use-of-proceeds (green, social) or performance-linked targets (sustainability-linked) satisfy market standards such as the Green Loan Principles (GLP) issued by the LMA, APLMA and LSTA (https://www.lsta.org/content/green-loan-principles). If a national classification standard is alreay in-play, this taxanomy should be used. The GLP require clear environmental objectives, transparent evaluation processes, ring-fenced proceeds, and regular reporting. Data requirements: Loan-level tagging for use-of-proceeds or sustainability-performance targets, mapped to the applicable taxonomy code. Up-to-date balances to build the numerator and denominator. Currency translation rates to consolidate multi-currency portfolios. Limitations and considerations: Fragmented standards: More than 30 national frameworks coexist, and self-labelled “green” loans can differ materially in scope, fuelling green-washing risk and hampering cross-border comparisons. Data immaturity: Many banks still retrofit legacy systems; incomplete tagging or missing verifier reports can understate true green exposure. Dynamic criteria: Ongoing revisions to taxonomy thresholds (e.g., the EU’s 2025 delegated acts) may reclassify loans ex-post, creating series breaks. Use-of-proceeds leakage: Proceeds must remain dedicated throughout the life of the loan; covenant breaches or refinancing can invalidate labels if not tracked.",individual and MSME,yes,volume and value,"Are there location, income and gender disparities in access to green/sustainable loans, including those for climate adaptation and resilience?

Definitions and concepts: A payroll loan (also called a payroll-deducted loan, salary loan) is a personal consumer loan whose installments are automatically withheld from the borrower’s pay-check (or pension/social-security benefit) and remitted directly to the lender each pay period. Because repayment is taken “off the top” of the employee’s gross salary, the borrower’s future income effectively serves as collateral, giving lenders high repayment certainty and allowing them to charge lower rates than on unsecured personal loans.

7,107,Insurance premiums written,Value of insurance premiums writen in the insurance sector,"Premiums written represent the contractual revenue an insurer books when it underwrites new or renewal policies during a given period, irrespective of when coverage is provided or cash is received. They are the starting point for recognising risk exposure, funding claims, and calculating acquisition commissions, solvency capital, and market-share rankings. Rising written-premium volumes can indicate growth, improved pricing power, or inflation-driven sum-assured increases; declining volumes may flag competitive pressures or tighter underwriting standards. Supervisors compare premium growth with changes in risk capital, claims experience, and persistency to assess whether expansion is sustainable. Definitions and concepts: Gross premiums written (GPW): All premiums on policies incepted or renewed during the period before ceding to reinsurers. Net premiums written (NPW): GPW minus premiums ceded plus any reinsurance assumed—reflects the risk the insurer retains. Earned premiums: Portion of written premiums recognised as revenue in proportion to expired coverage—crucial for loss-ratio analysis. Single vs. regular premiums: Single premiums (e.g., lump-sum annuities) can distort growth comparisons with level-pay policies unless separated. Life vs. non-life split: Life premiums include risk and savings components; non-life premiums are generally short-tailed and annual. Data requirements: Policy-level underwriting feeds: issue/renewal dates, premium amounts, payment mode, product line, distribution channel, currency. Bordereaux or treaty schedules for ceded and assumed reinsurance. Adjustments for cancellations, mid-term endorsements, and pending reinstatements.

8,112,Insurance claims incurred,Value of insurance claims incurred by the insurance sector ,"“Claims incurred” represents the total cost an insurer recognises for claims events that happened during a reporting period, regardless of whether they have been paid yet. It is the single largest component of the loss (or combined) ratio and the primary driver of underwriting profit, solvency requirements, and reserving needs. Tracking the level and trend of incurred claims helps supervisors, actuaries, and investors detect price inadequacy, benefit-design problems, or emerging risk clusters (e.g., climate-driven catastrophes, medical inflation). Definitions and concepts: Claims incurred = Claims paid + Change in outstanding claims reserves + Change in IBNR (incurred-but-not-reported) reserves ± Claims-handling expense reserve movements.
Gross vs. net: Gross figures exclude reinsurance recoveries; net figures include them, portraying the insurer’s retained loss.
Basis of valuation: IFRS 17 and many solvency regimes discount long-tail liabilities at risk-free (or prescribed) curves and include a risk adjustment; local GAAP may use undiscounted reserves.
Accident-year vs. underwriting-year triangles: Actuaries analyse incurred claims development to estimate ultimate losses and adequacy of reserves. Data requirements: Detailed paid-loss data by claim, line of business, accident/occurrence date, and settlement status. Opening and closing reserve balances, partitioned into outstanding, IBNR, and claims-handling expense components. Reinsurance recoverables and salvage/subrogation estimates for gross-to-net reconciliation.
Large-loss and catastrophe flags to isolate one-off shocks. Exposure measures (earned premium, policies in force) for ratio analysis.
Limitations and considerations: Reserve estimation risk: IBNR and long-tail lines rely on actuarial assumptions; small parameter shifts can materially alter incurred figures. Claims inflation: Medical or construction-cost inflation accelerates reserve growth, distorting year-on-year comparisons. Catastrophe volatility: Single severe events cause spikes; multi-year averages or catastrophe-adjusted ratios give clearer structural insight. Accounting divergence: Discounting practices, risk-margin treatment, and expense allocation differ across regimes, complicating cross-company benchmarking. Timing mismatch with premium: Premiums are often earned evenly, while incurred claims can be highly seasonal; combined-ratio analysis mitigates this effect.
Used alongside premium growth, loss-ratio components, and reserve-adequacy studies, “claims incurred” provides a cornerstone view of underwriting performance and balance-sheet resilience. Limitations and considerations: Timing and seasonality: Large commercial policies often renew at year-end, spiking fourth-quarter volumes; moving-average analysis smooths this effect. Reinsurance structure: Quota-share treaties lower NPW without reducing gross market presence—analysts should examine both bases. Accounting frameworks: IFRS 17 measures premiums through the contractual-service margin rather than GPW, complicating trend continuity across adoption dates. Single-premium bias: High single-premium life sales can inflate headline growth while providing limited recurring revenue. Pricing adequacy: Premium growth is positive only if matched by commensurate risk selection and claims experience; pairing written premiums with combined ratios and new-business strain provides a fuller performance lens.",individual and MSME,yes,value,"How has participation in claims incurred by insurance companies evolved by customer gender, both for individuals and MSMEs based on the gender of their owners?

Definitions and concepts: Transaction accounts are broadly defined as an account held with a bank or other authorised and/or regulated service provider (including a non-bank) which can be used to make and receive payments. Transaction accounts can be further differentiated into deposit transaction accounts and e-money accounts, including mobile money accounts. Data requirements: (1) List of transaction accounts geo-located to the residence of the account owner at a primary or secondary subnational administrative area, (2) Number of cash-in/cash-out financial access points for each administrative unit at the selected sub-national level, (3) Total adult population (or surface area) for each administative unit at the selected sub-national level. This indicator requires first computing the density of cash access points per subnational area in per-capita or km2 terms and defining a threshold below which the area is considered to have a low density of access points. The percentage of accounts in subnational areas at or below the density threshold can then be computed. ",individual,yes,volume,"Are women and low-income women (those with low average account balance) more likely to be in areas that are poorly served by cash access points? This analysis can help identify evidence of gender disparities in cash access, which could inform improvements in the distribution of cash access points with related adjustments to cash distribution. When compared with indicators on cash demand, this metric can highlight linkages between cash demand, account usage, and access to cash points. This indicator can be further enriched through demand-side surveys assessing the distance low-income customers must travel to withdraw cash, with focus on identifying gender disparities.","FI: Quality,

15,13,Deposit accounts covered by direct deposit insurance,Volume and value (balances) of accounts covered by direct deposit insurance,"This indicator counts (or expresses as a percentage) the deposit accounts that fall within the scope of an explicit, statutory deposit insurance scheme (DIS). It helps supervisors gauge how much of the retail/SME funding base is protected against bank failure—key for financial-stability messaging, payout readiness, and calibrating the deposit insurance fund. High coverage supports confidence and can dampen run dynamics; very low coverage may leave households and small firms exposed and raise contagion risk. Definitions and concepts: Covered (eligible) account: a deposit type included by law (e.g., demand/current, savings, time deposits); excludes typical carve-outs such as interbank deposits, securities, bearer instruments, and sometimes public-sector or affiliate deposits. Fully insured vs. partially insured: “Fully insured” balances are ≤ the coverage limit per depositor, per bank, per ownership category; “covered/eligible” may include accounts whose balances exceed the cap (partially insured). Ownership categories: individual, joint, trust/fiduciary, retirement—rules vary by jurisdiction and affect aggregation across accounts. Indicator variants: % Eligible accounts = eligible deposit accounts ÷ total deposit accounts. % Fully insured accounts = accounts with balances ≤ applicable limit ÷ eligible accounts. Insured balance share = insured amounts ÷ total deposit balances. Data requirements:
Core-banking ledger of all deposit accounts with product code, currency, balance, owner ID, and ownership category. Rules engine reflecting national DIS scope, limits, and aggregation logic (per depositor–per bank). Mapping to exclude ineligible accounts (interbank, affiliates), and to consolidate subsidiaries within a licensed bank. Limitations and considerations: Aggregation & identity quality: duplicate or inconsistent customer identifiers can misstate “fully insured” status.
Jurisdictional differences: coverage limits, eligible products, and treatment of foreign-currency and branch deposits vary which can mek cross-country comparisons difficult. Pass-through accounts: incomplete beneficiary data may undercount coverage. Dormancy: dormant or unclaimed funds may be treated differently in coverage statistics. Volatility: promo campaigns and quarter-end window-dressing can momentarily skew account counts and balances.

270,14,E-money accounts covered by pass through deposit insurance (or other),Volume and value (balances) of accounts covered by pass through deposit insurance,"This indicator quantifies how much of the e-money customer base is protected if the issuer or its partner bank fails. It can be shown as a count or share of e-money accounts with eligible pass-through coverage, and/or the insured share of the e-money float (balances). Because most e-money models pool customer funds in safeguarded/escrow accounts at one or more banks, coverage depends on whether protection “passes through” to each named beneficiary. A higher covered share bolsters consumer confidence and limits run risk in stress events; gaps highlight operational, legal, or documentation weaknesses. Definitions and concepts: Pass-through deposit insurance: protection that extends from the custodian bank account to each end-user, subject to jurisdictional rules (e.g., per-beneficiary limits, record-keeping, and titling of accounts). Other protection mechanisms: statutory safeguarding/segregation, trust arrangements, guarantee funds, or private insurance that protect against issuer insolvency even if deposit insurance does not apply. Indicator formulas: % covered accounts = eligible e-money accounts with verified pass-through (or other) protection ÷ total active e-money accounts.
Insured balance share = insured (or safeguarded) amounts attributable to identifiable beneficiaries ÷ total e-money float. Data requirements: Mapping of wallet IDs to beneficiary identities and balances; status flags (active/dormant, KYC tier). Custodial banking details: account titling showing fiduciary/for-benefit-of status, participating banks, and deposit insurance scheme membership.  Limitations & considerations: Jurisdictional variability: some regimes grant deposit insurance via pass-through; others rely on safeguarding without deposite insurance.
Record-keeping quality: incomplete or duplicate identifiers can understate insured shares.

16,15,G2P accounts covered by deposit insurance,% of all accounts held by G2P recipients that are covered by deposit protection,"This indicator quantifies how much of the government-to-person (G2P) payments ecosystem is protected by an explicit deposit insurance scheme. It can be shown as (a) the share of G2P accounts that are eligible/fully insured and/or (b) the insured share of G2P balances. High coverage strengthens public confidence in digital transfers, dampens run risk around paydays, and informs both payout-readiness and the calibration of the deposit insurance fund. Low coverage highlights legal or operational gaps (e.g., pooled wallets without pass-through) that may undermine financial-inclusion goals. Definitions  and concepts: G2P account: an account designated to receive social transfers, pensions, subsidies, or cash-benefit programs.
Covered (eligible) vs. fully insured: “Eligible” products fall within the deposit insurance scope; “fully insured” means the balance per beneficiary per insured bank does not exceed the coverage cap. Pass-through coverage: for pooled/“for-benefit-of” or prepaid/e-money models, insurance applies to named beneficiaries only if account titling and sub-ledger records meet scheme rules.
Indicator formulas: % eligible G2P accounts = eligible G2P accounts ÷ total active G2P accounts.
% fully insured G2P accounts = accounts with balance ≤ coverage limit ÷ eligible accounts. Insured balance share = insured amounts attributable to beneficiaries ÷ total G2P balances. Data requirements: Beneficiary registry with unique IDs linked to bank/wallet account numbers.
Core-banking (and, where applicable, e-money) extracts: product code, ownership category, end-of-day balance, currency. Rules engine encoding national deposit-insurance scope, limits, and aggregation logic (per depositor—per bank). Sub-ledger data for pooled/FBO accounts to support pass-through eligibility. FX translation and group consolidation for multi-bank or multi-currency programs. Limitations & considerations: Jurisdictional variation: some regimes insure only bank deposits; others rely on safeguarding for e-money—state the basis used. Identity & deduplication: weak KYC or multiple IDs can misstate “per depositor” aggregation. Timing sensitivity: balances spike on disbursement days; define the snapshot (e.g., month-end vs. T+2 after payout). Program design: joint/household accounts, agent-mediated cash-outs, or auto-sweeps to wallets alter insured status.

158,17,Balance in inactive and dormant accounts,% of total transaction account balances that are held in inactive and dormant accounts,"This indicator shows the share of funds sitting in transaction (checking/current) accounts that are not actively used by customers. High concentrations of idle balances can signal weak customer engagement, poor product fit, or frictions in account usage—important for financial-inclusion quality, liquidity management, and conduct risk. From a prudential angle, large dormant balances may look “stable” but can reverse if reactivation drives or policy changes prompt withdrawals. For consumer protection, persistent dormancy raises risks around unclaimed funds, fees, and fraud. Definitions and concepts: Transaction accounts: demand/current accounts and other payment-capable deposit accounts. Inactive account: no customer-initiated debit/credit (card use, cash withdrawal/deposit, transfer) for a defined window (e.g., ≥90 or 180 days). System entries (interest, fees, bank corrections) don’t count. Dormant account: extended inactivity beyond a longer threshold (commonly ≥12 months) that may trigger special handling (restricted access, outreach, escheatment). Indicator formula: Balances in inactive + dormant transaction accounts divided by total transaction-account balances. Reporting the split (inactive vs. dormant) can provide further detail. Data requirements: Core-banking ledger with end-of-day balances, product codes, and last customer-initiated activity timestamp per account. Classification rules reflecting local definitions (inactive/dormant thresholds; treatment of standing orders/auto-debits). Ownership segment (retail/SME), currency, and insured/uninsured flags. Optional: outreach attempts, reactivation outcomes, and fee assessments to monitor conduct risk. Limitations & considerations: Definition divergence: thresholds and what counts as “activity” vary by jurisdiction and even by institution—state methodology clearly. Data quality: some channels (agents, fintech front-ends) may not update the core “last activity” field, overstating dormancy.
Seasonality & cycles: balances can spike around payroll/tax periods; use consistent month-end or averages.

31,20,Balance of suspense deposit accounts,Value of balances of suspense accounts,"Suspense deposit accounts are temporary holding ledgers used when a deposit‐related transaction cannot be posted to its final customer account because critical details are missing or disputed (e.g., incorrect account number, unmatched inward remittance, garnishment order). The balance of suspense deposit accounts aggregates the outstanding debit or credit amounts awaiting resolution. Persistently high or growing balances signal weaknesses in reconciliation, client on-boarding, Know-Your-Customer (KYC) data quality, or payment-processing controls. They can mask fraud, facilitate money-laundering layering, or inflate reported deposits, so supervisors view the metric as an operational-risk and conduct-risk early-warning indicator. Definitions and concepts: Suspense deposit account: a general-ledger account that temporarily records cash inflows/outflows linked to customer deposits until the entry can be matched and posted correctly. Ageing buckets: many regulators require stratification of balances (0-30, 31-90, 91-180, >180 days) to highlight items that exceed policy tolerance windows. Resolution policy: internal rule defining maximum days outstanding and escalation steps (automatic reversal, contact centre follow-up, compliance review). Net vs. gross view: some banks offset debit and credit suspense positions, but risk assessments typically focus on the gross absolute balance. Data requirements: Daily general-ledger extracts of all suspense deposit accounts, with transaction identifiers, value dates, counter-party data, and original payment channels (ACH, wire, cheque, cash). Ageing analysis and reason codes (data error, KYC pending, legal hold). Reconciliation logs between core-banking, payments switch, and customer-account modules. Incident or fraud flags linked to suspense items for thematic reviews. Limitations and considerations: Accounting practices vary: some institutions clear items by moving them to internal “parking” accounts that may not be labelled suspense, understating the indicator. Offsetting distortions: netting credits against debits can hide gross operational exposure; regulators may require gross disclosure. System migrations: large IT conversions can temporarily inflate suspense balances, so trend analysis should incorporate project timelines. Regulatory treatment: in certain jurisdictions, long-dated unresolved credits must be escheated to the state or treated as unclaimed funds; failure to do so can trigger penalties. Regular monitoring—paired with strict ageing limits, root-cause analysis, and automated reconciliation tools—helps ensure suspense deposit balances remain transient and immaterial, preserving balance-sheet integrity and customer trust.",individual and MSME,yes,value,"Are there gender disparities in the average amount of funds in suspense accounts, including for low-income customers and MSMEs based on the ownership gender?

Overlaying the geographic distribution of transaction accounts on the geographic distribution of cash circulation can help to better understand the demand for and use of accounts. Definitions and concepts: Transaction accounts are broadly defined as an account held with a bank or other authorised and/or regulated service provider (including a non-bank) which can be used to make and receive payments. Transaction accounts can be further differentiated into deposit transaction accounts and e-money accounts, including mobile money accounts. While the overall supply of cash is determined by monetary policy that influences the level of currency in circulation, demand for cash concerns how the population chooses to spread currency across different activities, including (1) legal payments, (2) cash savings and (3) other transactions involving cash for use abroad, corruption or tax avoidance (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/03/17/Measurement-and-Use-of-Cash-by-Half-the-Worlds-Population-531077). The demand for cash can be proxied by the aggregate volume of cash withdrawals. Inactive (or dormant) accounts refers to an account that has not been used to conduct transactions (e.g. deposits, withdrawals, transfers) over a long period of time prior to a specific reference date (e.g. one year). Passive transactions such as interest deposits are usually excluded. Data requirements: (1) List of transaction accounts geo-located to the residence of the account owner at a primary or secondary subnational administrative area, (2) Proxy for demand for cash: E.g.  total cash withdrawals over a specified period for each administrative unit at the sleected sub-national level,  (3) Total adult population (or surface area) for each administrative unit at the selected subnational level.

Definitions and concepts: Restructured (or renegotiated / forborne) loan: an exposure whose cash-flow terms have been modified for credit-risk reasons and would not have been granted under comparable market conditions (Basel, EBA, IFRS 9). Troubled Debt Restructuring (TDR): US-GAAP term for modifications that result in a concession to a borrower in financial distress. Indicator formulas: Restructured loans ÷ Gross loans (stock measure); New restructurings during period ÷ Performing loans entering arrears (flow measure). Interaction with staging: under IFRS 9, most restructured loans migrate to Stage 2 (lifetime ECL) unless they are already Stage 3 (credit-impaired). Data requirements: Loan-level flags for modification type, date, and reason code. Original vs. revised contractual cash-flows to assess economic concession. Borrower financials to justify “ability to repay” assessment. Subsequent performance data (cures, relapses, write-offs) for back-testing. Comparable data on NPLs and write-offs to analyse migration paths. Limitations and considerations: Regulatory divergence: Some jurisdictions treat any concession as a restructuring; others exclude purely administrative changes, hampering cross-country comparisons. Forbearance episodes: Crisis-era moratoria or government-mandated payment holidays may inflate restructuring volumes temporarily, masking true borrower weakness. Ever-greening risk: Serial restructurings can keep loans classified as “performing” while delaying loss recognition; monitor repeat modification flags and eventual cure rates. Provisioning judgment: Determining whether a restructuring represents a significant credit-risk increase (Stage 2) relies on qualitative criteria that can differ across banks. Portfolio mix effects: High-yield consumer portfolios often show higher restructuring rates than collateralised mortgages; segment analysis is essential.

24,84,Delinquency rate in the retail loan portfolio,Volume and value of delinquent retail loans as a proportion of total retail portfolio,"The delinquency rate tracks the share of consumer-facing loans—mortgages, credit-cards, instalment loans, auto, buy-now-pay-later, qualifying SMEs—that have fallen past due but have not yet crossed the “non-performing” threshold or been written off. Rising early-stage arrears are an early-warning signal of household stress and of future spikes in non-performing loans (NPLs), provisions and write-offs. Supervisors and risk managers use the metric to test the effectiveness of underwriting standards, collections strategies and pricing for credit risk. Definitions and concepts: Loan delinquency refers to a situation in which borrowed money is not paid back as agreed. A loan becomes delinquent when a borrower makes payments late or misses a regular installment payment or payments. When a loan is delinquent, the borrower failed to make their payment on time. A delinquent loan is any kind of loan that has past due payments but has yet to go into default. Data requirements: Loan-level payment history with “days-past-due” (DPD) counters updated daily.  On a value basis, this indicator measures the total outstanding balances past due (for example greaterr than 30 but less than 90 days past due) as a share of gross retail loan balances at the end of a specified period. Limitations and considerations: Policy relief: Payment holidays, deferrals or re-aging can artificially depress delinquency while latent risk builds. Portfolio mix effects: A push into unsecured lending will raise the rate even if segment-specific quality is unchanged; segment by product and risk grade. Vintage seasoning: Young portfolios normally show higher early arrears—compare cohorts of similar age. Operational cut-offs: Inconsistent days past due calculation (calendar days vs. business days, partial payments) hinders cross-bank comparability.

263,85,Loan loss provisions,% of the outstanding loan portfolio set aside as provisions for expected credit losses,"Loan loss provisions (LLPs) are the expenses a bank records to cover expected credit losses on its loan portfolio. They represent management’s best estimate of future cash shortfalls arising from borrower defaults or deteriorating credit quality. Adequate provisioning is critical for portraying true earnings, maintaining solvency, and sustaining market confidence. Under-provisioning inflates short-term profits but erodes capital when losses materialise; over-provisioning can misstate performance and distort lending incentives. Definitions & concepts: Loan Loss Provision (expense) – the profit-and-loss charge that increases the Allowance for Expected Credit Losses (ECL) on the balance sheet. IFRS 9 three-stage model:
Stage 1 – 12-month ECL for performing exposures.
Stage 2 – lifetime ECL for assets with significant credit-risk increase.
Stage 3 – lifetime ECL for credit-impaired (non-performing) assets.
Coverage ratio – Allowance for ECL ÷ Gross non-performing loans; gauges the cushion against identified problem loans.
Provisioning ratio – LLP expense ÷ Average gross loans; compares flow of provisions to portfolio size.
Data requirements: Loan-level probability-of-default (PD), loss-given-default (LGD) and exposure-at-default (EAD) parameters, segmented by product, geography, collateral type and borrower rating. Macroeconomic scenarios (baseline & adverse) to derive forward-looking ECL. Historical cure, write-off and recovery data for model calibration. Management overlays documenting qualitative judgements (e.g., sectoral stress, emerging risks). Audited financial statements to extract opening/closing allowances and P&L charges.
Limitations and considerations: Model risk & judgement: Small changes in PD, LGD or scenario weights can materially alter provisions; transparent governance and back-testing are essential. Cyclicality: Forward-looking IFRS 9 rules can generate “provision pro-cyclicality,” with sharp spikes in downturns that magnify credit contractions.
Comparability: National GAAP banks (incurred-loss rules) or US GAAP (CECL) follow different methodologies, complicating peer analysis.
Management overlays: Discretionary adjustments can smooth earnings or compensate for model blind spots; disclosures should explain rationale and sensitivity. Macroeconomic uncertainty: In volatile environments, scenario design and weighting become highly subjective, increasing forecast error.

22,86,NPLs in the retail portfolio,Non performing loans rate in the retail loan portfolio,"The NPL indicator for the retail book quantifies the share (or absolute value) of consumer and small-business loans that are unlikely to be fully repaid. Because retail credit typically involves high volumes of granular, unsecured exposures, a build-up of NPLs signals mounting credit-risk costs, pressure on provisioning, and potential stress for both lenders and the broader financial system. Supervisors track this metric to assess banks’ underwriting standards, resilience to economic shocks, and the effectiveness of early-arrears management. Definitions and concepts: An NPL is generally defined as a loan that is 90 days past-due on contractual payments or is otherwise in default or unlikely to pay (Basel & IFRS 9 definitions align with this threshold). The retail portfolio encompasses exposures to individuals and qualifying SMEs treated under the retail asset class. The most common ratio is Gross NPLs ÷ Gross retail loans; some variants net out interest-in-suspense or use Stage 3 gross carrying amount under IFRS 9. Data requirements: Loan-level ageing data with days-past-due flags. Classification status (performing, Stage 2, Stage 3, written-off). Outstanding principal, accrued interest, and collateral values (for loss-given-default analysis). Vintage or origination cohorts to distinguish structural vs. cyclic deterioration. Limitations and considerations: Definition drift: Some jurisdictions use 60- or 180-day thresholds, hindering cross-country comparisons.

262,87,Write offs ratio (retail loans),Volume and value of written off retail loans as a proportion of total retail portfolio,"The write-offs ratio tracks the portion of retail-portfolio loans that a lender permanently removes from its balance sheet within a period because collection is deemed impossible or uneconomic. It is a forward-looking credit-risk barometer: rising write-offs shrink the loan book, erode earnings through higher impairment charges, and may reveal weaknesses in underwriting or collections. Regulators examine the indicator alongside new-NPL formation and provisioning coverage to judge whether banks are recognising losses promptly or postponing them through restructurings. Definitions and concepts: Write-offs ratio is usually expressed as (Gross retail loan write-offs during period ÷ Average gross retail loans outstanding). Write-off: an accounting action that derecognises the unrecoverable portion of a loan’s amortised cost; it does not preclude further collections, which are recognised as recoveries. Retail loans: exposures to individuals and qualifying small businesses treated under the retail asset class for capital purposes (mortgages, credit-cards, personal instalment loans, SME overdrafts, BNPL, etc.). Distinction from charge-offs (US usage) is largely semantic; both eliminate carrying value. Data requirements: General ledger entries detailing gross charge/write-offs by product line. Opening and closing balances (or average) of gross retail loans, ideally split by risk segment and geography. Recoveries data to analyse net loss rates.
Policy documentation on write-off triggers (days-past-due, bankruptcy, collateral sale completion). Limitations and considerations:  Timing disparities: Institutions with aggressive 180-day charge-off policies show higher ratios than peers that delay write-offs until legal exhaustion, complicating comparisons. Macroeconomic overlays: Regulatory forbearance (e.g., pandemic payment holidays) may defer write-offs and understate latent risk. Portfolio mix effects: A surge in unsecured lending can lift the ratio even if asset quality within each segment is stable. Recoveries opaque: High write-offs can be mitigated later by recoveries; analysing “net loss rate” (write-offs minus recoveries) over the loan’s life provides a fuller picture. Trend analysis over multiple cycles, complemented by flow metrics such as “write-offs to new NPLs,” helps isolate structural deterioration from policy or accounting changes.",individual and MSME,no,volume and value,"Is there a gender disparity in the incidence of loan write-offs?

183,93,Cost to customer for retail borrowers,Average topline revenue earned from retail credit operations (as percentage of the average outstanding unsecured credit),"This indicator is a portfolio-level proxy for the all-in price actually paid by customers on unsecured retail credit during the period. It answers: How many currency units of revenue did the lender earn for each 100 units of average unpaid balance? Rising values may reflect higher base rates, heavier fee reliance (e.g., late/over-limit charges), or a shift toward shorter-tenor/high-yield products; falling values can indicate competitive pressure, promotional pricing, or relief programs. Boards, supervisors, and consumer-protection teams use it to benchmark pricing fairness, earnings quality, and sensitivity to interest-rate cycles. Definitions and concepts: Recommended numerator (topline revenue, P&L-recognized): Interest income (EIR basis) + contractual fees (origination, servicing) + penalty/default interest actually recognized + punitive fees (late, over-limit, returned-payment) − waivers/reversals. Denominator: Average outstanding unsecured retail balances (use Average Daily Balance - ADB). Formula: Cost-to-customer yield = Topline revenue from unsecured retail credit divded by Average outstanding unsecured retail balances. This indicator can be reported separately for interest, contractual fees and penalities if the data is available and when the period is less than 12 months, report an annualized figure.

A high share can signal affordability stress and conduct-risk (fee-harvesting, opaque terms), create earnings volatility (fees fall when relief programs run), and invite supervisory scrutiny or caps. Used with delinquency and complaint metrics, it helps boards judge whether growth is sustainable and customer outcomes are fair. Definitions and concepts: Penalty / punitive charges (numerator): late-payment fees, over-limit fees, returned-payment/NSF fees, delinquency/default charges, collections/admin penalties, and (policy choice) the penalty-interest differential (interest above the contractual rate once in default). Topline revenue from unsecured credit (denominator): interest income (EIR basis) + fees/commissions directly attributable to unsecured products (excludes interchange on purchase volume unless you choose to include it consistently). Scope clarifiers: exclude origination/processing fees (not punitive), dispute reversals counted net, and stop-accrual rules for non-performing loans. Formula: [Penalty fees + (optional) penalty-interest differential - waviers/refunds/chargebakcs] divided by [Total unsecured-credit revenue]. Data requirements: General-ledger revenue by product with fee taxonomy (late, over-limit, NSF, collections, penalty interest).

267,95,Interest rate spreads (loans),Difference between the average lending rate and a reference rate (e.g. deposit rate or external reference rate),"The interest-rate spread on loans captures the margin between the average contractual rate a bank charges borrowers and an external reference rate—typically the policy rate, the interbank offered rate (IBOR), or the yield on sovereign bills of comparable tenor. It is a concise gauge of (i) banks’ credit-risk pricing, (ii) competitive conditions in the lending market, and (iii) monetary-policy transmission. Wider spreads may reflect higher perceived borrower risk, limited competition, or funding-cost pressures; persistently narrow spreads can point to aggressive underwriting or excess liquidity that may undermine future asset quality. Definitions and concepts:  Loan interest-rate spread (simple): Average contractual loan rate minus Reference rate measured for new originations or for the stock of loans. Net lending spread: average loan rate minus average deposit rate, often used when policy benchmarks are volatile. Risk-adjusted spread: spread net of expected credit losses, revealing the “pure” return for bearing credit risk. Segmented spreads: calculated by product (e.g., mortgages, SMEs, credit cards) or by borrower rating to isolate pricing behaviour.
Data requirements: Loan-level or portfolio-level interest-rate data, including rate type (fixed / floating), repricing frequency, currency, and residual maturity. Daily or monthly reference-rate series (policy, IBOR, or treasury yields). Weighting factors (loan balances or origination volumes) to compute weighted-average rates. Credit-risk parameters (PD, LGD) if a risk-adjusted view is desired. Limitations & considerations: Benchmark choice matters: using a short-term policy rate for long-term loans introduces tenor mismatch; aligning maturities or using swap curves yields cleaner signals. Composition effects: a shift toward low-risk, collateralised lending can narrow the spread even if pricing policy is unchanged—segmentation controls are essential.
Regulatory caps or subsidies: mandated interest-rate ceilings or credit-guarantee programs distort market-driven spreads. Non-interest charges: fees and cross-selling income are excluded; the true all-in lending margin may be higher. Lag in repricing: floating-rate loans adjust with a delay, so measured spreads can under- or over-state current pricing in rapidly moving rate environments. Tracked over time and across peer institutions, interest-rate spreads provide insights into credit-cycle turning points, profitability dynamics, and the effectiveness of monetary-policy signals reaching the real economy.",individual and MSME,no,value,"Are there gender disparities in loan and deposit interest rates?

A high share often signals borrower stress and potential conduct-risk (reliance on punitive pricing), and it makes earnings more cyclical—penalty interest collapses when hardship or forbearance programs are introduced. Boards and supervisors use the metric to assess earnings quality, pricing fairness, and the interaction with arrears and write-offs. Definitions and concepts: Penalty/default interest: the incremental rate (spread above the contractual/base rate) charged once an account is past due or in breach.Numerator (preferred “incremental” view): Penalty-interest differential actually recognized as interest income on unsecured products during the period (net of reversals/waivers). Denominator: Total NII of the institution (interest income minus interest expense). Consider a companion view using unsecured-book interest income in the denominator for a product-specific ratio. Recognition regime matters: under non-accrual policies or IFRS 9 Stage 3, interest may be recognized on net carrying amount or moved to interest-in-suspense—include only amounts recognized in P&L. Data requirements: General-ledger mapping that splits standard vs. penalty interest at product level; flags for reversals, waivers, and cash recoveries. Loan/card-level fields: DPD status, penalty-rate start/stop dates, base rate, non-accrual/on-accrual-resumption events. Period NII totals (institution-wide) for the denominator.
Policy notes: when penalty interest starts, cure rules, and whether capitalization is allowed. Limitations and considerations: Comparability: different non-accrual and Stage 3 practices; some classify penalty amounts as fees instead of interest. Collectability: accrued but uncollected penalty interest that is later reversed can overstate quality; track reversal rates.

185,97,Processing and application fees or PAF (as % of loan principal),PAF as % of loan principal in unsecured credit operations,"This indicator expresses the total up-front charges borrowers pay to originate an unsecured loan—processing fees, application fees, documentation charges—as a percentage of the loan’s principal amount. Because unsecured credit often targets price-sensitive segments and carries higher risk-based interest rates, excessive PAFs can materially raise the all-in cost of borrowing, undermine affordability tests, and trigger consumer-protection scrutiny. Tracking the ratio helps regulators detect predatory pricing, compare lenders’ transparency practices, and gauge competition in loan-origination services. For lenders, it is a barometer of non-interest revenue reliance and a lever for recouping acquisition costs. Processing & Application Fees (PAF): any non-refundable charge levied at or before disbursement for administrative tasks (credit checks, KYC, documentation, platform usage). Late-payment or insurance fees are excluded.
PAF ratio (simple): [Total PAF charged/Gross loan principal]×100%
Where multiple partial disbursements occur, use the aggregate principal amount. Annualised impact: when PAFs are capitalised into the Effective Annual Percentage Rate (APR), their weight declines as term length rises—monitor both absolute and APR-embedded views. Data requirements: Loan-level records capturing principal, disbursement date, PAF amount, and any rebates for cancellations. Product codes distinguishing personal instalment loans, credit-card cash advances, payday/BNPL equivalents. Borrower demographics and channel identifiers (branch, mobile app, marketplace) for segmentation. Accounting entries showing whether fees are recognised up-front (IFRS 15 “contract costs”) or amortised via the effective-interest-rate (EIR) method. Limitations and considerations: Amortisation differences: Lenders using EIR spread PAFs over the loan’s life; comparing ratios on a cash basis versus amortised income can mislead. Bundled products: Cross-selling (e.g., credit-life insurance) may shift income from PAF to commissions, understating the ratio. Regulatory caps & disclosures: Jurisdictions with fee ceilings or mandatory APR disclosures compress PAF ratios; cross-country benchmarking must control for such rules. Loan term effects: Short-tenor payday or BNPL loans show high PAF percentages even when absolute fees are small; interpret in context of maturity profile and APR.

285,99,Debt service-to-income ratio,% of income allocated to retail credit debt repayment ,"The debt service-to-Income ratio,  sometimes referred to more concisely as the debt service ratio (DSR) expresses a borrower’s (or household’s) total debt-service burden relative to recurring income, answering a simple question: How much of each income unit is already pledged to repay existing debt? At the micro level, lenders use DSR to assess repayment capacity, price credit, and comply with responsible-lending rules. At the macro level, supervisors track average or distributional DSR to gauge household vulnerability to interest-rate shocks and to calibrate macro-prudential tools such as loan-to-income caps. Definitions and concepts: Debt payments include principal, interest, mandatory insurance on retail credit facilities;  Income can be defined in gross terms (pre-tax income (salary) plus verifiable recurring earning) or net terms (income after taxes and social-security contributions). Data requirements: Current loan statements or credit-bureau/registry reports detailing payment amounts, remaiming term, and interest rate for all obligations; Recent payslips, audited financial statements (self-fmployed), tax returns, and verified rental or pension income. Limitations and considerations: Income volatility: informal or gig-economy or commission-based earnings make future cash flows uncertain; Undisclosed liabilities: informal or unreported debts escape bureau coverage, understating true DSR. Household composition: shared living expenses and co-borrower support can distort individual ratios; some frameworks use household disposable income instead. Interest-rate path: fixed-rate loans keep payments stable, while floating-rate debt can raise DSR sharply when policy rates rise.

56,114,Insurance loss ratio,% of total premium income paid out as claims,"The claims paid ratio compares the amount of benefits and claims an insurer actually disburses during a period with the premium income it records for the same portfolio. It answers a basic question for supervisors, policy-holders, and analysts: How much of each premium dollar flows back to customers in the form of claims? Persistently low ratios may flag overly aggressive pricing, onerous exclusions, or servicing bottlenecks, while very high ratios can foreshadow reserve inadequacy, under-pricing, or a spike in catastrophe losses. In combination with the expense ratio, the indicator feeds into the overall loss or combined ratio that underpins solvency and profitability assessments. Definitions and concepts: Claims paid: cash actually settled with policy-holders and claimants in the accounting period, including partial payments and salvage recoveries netted where local GAAP allows. It excludes outstanding claims reserves and IBNR, which are captured by “claims incurred.” Gross vs. net basis: gross claims ignore reinsurance recoveries; net claims deduct them, better reflecting the insurer’s retained risk. Segmented ratios (e.g., motor, health, property) pinpoint product-level profitability. Data requirements: Extracts from the claims-management system showing paid amounts, dates, line of business, and reinsurance cessions. Premium registers (written or earned, depending on supervisory preference) reconciled to the general ledger. Catastrophe tags, legal-settlement flags, and large-loss registers to isolate one-off distortions. Limitations & considerations: Timing mismatch: annual premiums are often received up-front, whereas claim payments can lag; using earned premiums mitigates, but does not eliminate, this distortion. Claims-handling practices: delayed settlement or dispute escalation depresses the ratio without improving true risk experience. Reinsurance structure: quota-share vs. excess-of-loss treaties change the net ratio dramatically; analysts should review both gross and net perspectives. Regulatory definitions: some jurisdictions fold surrenders of savings-type contracts into claims, inflating comparability.

198,115,Insurance approved claims not paid,% of approved/accepted claims that remain unpaid to customers,"This indicator shows the share of claims that have been approved (final liability accepted) but not yet disbursed to the claimant. A high rate flags operational bottlenecks, weak payout controls, KYC/AML frictions, banking detail errors, or customer-contact failures—directly impacting customer outcomes and conduct risk. For solvency and liquidity, it signals accruals that have not converted to cash outflows and may point to reconciliation issues between claims and finance systems. Track alongside turnaround time, claims rejection/decline rates, and complaints upheld to get a full picture of payout effectiveness and customer fairness. Definitions and concepts: Approved / accepted claim: a claim with a final decision to pay (post-assessment), a recorded payable, and no outstanding dispute. Unpaid status: no successful settlement to the beneficiary by period end (or within a defined service-level agreement - SLA - window). Formula: Amount weighted (unpaid approved amount ÷ approved amount) reveal economic impact. Count basis (# approved claims not paid by cut-off ÷ # claims approved in teh period). SLA variant: % not paid within X days of approval (e.g., 5/10/30 days) to neutralize end-period timing bias. Treatment of partial payments: disclose whether partially paid claims are counted as unpaid or excluded. Data requirements: Claims-system fields: claim ID, product/LOB, approval date, approved amount, payment instruction date, payment method, beneficiary details, and payment status (settled/returned/pending/held). Payment rails & finance data: bank returns (RTP/ACH/wire), cheque status, e-money payouts, GL accruals, and reconciliations.Reason codes for non-payment: missing KYC, incorrect bank details, lien/set-off, legal/fraud hold, beneficiary deceased, sanctions hit, claimant non-response. SLA timestamps to compute “paid within X days.” Limitations and considerations: Cut-off effects: approvals late in the period will naturally be unpaid—use the SLA variant and report both snapshot and flow views.
Classification risk: some teams postpone “approval” until payment files are ready, artificially lowering the metric—define approval uniformly. Partial/returned payments: bounced or stale cheques, closed accounts, or rejected transfers require clear mapping (count as unpaid until successfully reissued).

59,116,Insurance claims turnaround time, Average number of days to process insurance claims,"This indicator captures the average calendar days an insurer takes to settle a claim—from the First Notice of Loss (FNOL) to the final payment or formal denial. It is a direct yard-stick of operational efficiency and customer experience: shorter turnaround times (TATs) enhance policy-holder trust, limit reputational risk, and can lower claims-handling expenses. Supervisors use the metric to enforce fair-treatment rules, while actuaries and underwriters link it to reserving accuracy—prolonged settlement can signal documentation bottlenecks, fraud investigations, or catastrophic complexity that may keep outstanding reserves elevated. Definitions and concepts:  Start point – the timestamp when the insurer (or its agent/TPA) first receives verifiable claim information (FNOL). End point – the date the insurer issues full payment, partial final payment, or a written denial accepted by the claimant. Average TAT – arithmetic mean; many firms also monitor median and 90th-percentile to limit outlier masking.
Segmented TATs – tracked by line of business (motor, health, property), claim severity band, and distribution channel to isolate problem areas.
Regulatory service-level agreements (SLAs) – some jurisdictions impose maximum TATs (e.g., 30 days for uncomplicated health claims).
Data requirements: Claims-management-system extracts with FNOL date, interim request dates, settlement/denial dates, payment amounts, cause of loss, and reinsurance flags. Workflow status logs to pinpoint internal hand-offs (adjuster assignment, legal review).
Catastrophe identifiers to separate surge events from BAU volumes.
Limitations and considerations: Heterogeneous complexity: Cat or liability claims naturally take longer; aggregated averages must be risk-adjusted for mix. Partial settlements: Recording the date of first partial payment can understate full-and-final completion time. Dispute and litigation pauses: Regulatory or court‐mandated suspensions inflate TAT yet lie outside managerial control. Data quality: Missing or overwritten timestamps compromise accuracy; strict audit trails are essential.
Incentive distortions: Excessive focus on speed may encourage premature denials or under-reserving; pair TAT with reopen rates and complaint metrics.

61,117,Insurance policy downgrade rate,"% of policies downgraded at the customer's request (e.g.,  lower coverage, higher deductiblees, removal of riders, switch to a lower tier plan)","This indicator tracks the share of in-force policies that customers voluntarily reduce in coverage during the period. Elevated downgrade activity can signal affordability stress, product misfit, or competitive pressure (customers trading down to cheaper plans). It affects revenue (lower premiums), risk mix (higher deductibles shift loss ratios), and persistency (downgrades may precede lapses or surrenders). Supervisors and boards use the metric to monitor customer outcomes and pricing adequacy, and to gauge the effectiveness of retention strategies that preserve cover while easing budgets. Definitions and concepts: Downgrade (customer-initiated): a mid-term endorsement or renewal change that reduces coverage level—e.g., lower sum assured/benefit limits, higher deductibles/co-pays, removal of riders, downgrade of plan tier.
Exclusions: underwriter-initiated reductions, age-or regulation-driven benefit step-downs, claim-related restrictions, and administrative corrections. Formula (count basis): # policies with customer-requested downgrades in period divided by # active (or renewing) policies in period. Also report premium-weighted share using pre-change written premium for economic impact, and split mid-term vs at-renewal downgrades. Data requirements: Policy-level endorsements with: effective date, pre/post premium, pre/post coverage attributes (sum assured, limits, deductibles, riders), channel, product, tenure, and reason code (affordability, competitor offer, benefit redundancy, etc.). Renewal records to identify plan-tier switches. Linkages to subsequent outcomes (lapse, claim, complaint) for behavioural insights. Limitations and considerations: Multiple events: the same policy may downgrade more than once—decide event vs. policy-unique counting. Product mapping: ensure consistent tier/benefit taxonomy across products and vintages. Mix effects: shifts toward high-deductible plans can lower premiums and paid claims—analyse loss ratios alongside.

256,118,Insurance claims declined,% of claims logged by policyholders that are declined prior to substantive analysis,"This indicator captures the share of claim notifications the insurer does not accept for assessment at the front door—typically during first notice of loss (FNOL)/triage—because they are clearly ineligible or incomplete. A high intake-decline rate can point to unclear policy wording, poor customer guidance, data-capture frictions, or overly strict gatekeeping. It is a key conduct-risk and customer-experience signal and, operationally, helps size avoidable workload versus genuinely assessable claims. Claim logged / FNOL: the moment a policyholder submits a claim or loss notice. Declined at intake (non-acceptance): the insurer refuses to open an assessable claim before investigation (e.g., policy not in force, peril not covered, waiting period, duplicate claim, claim below deductible/threshold, incomplete mandatory data not cured within a set window). Indicator formula (count basis): # claims declined at intake in period divided by # claim notifications received in period . Variants: exclude cured cases later resubmitted; report by product/channel. Data requirements: Claims-intake system fields: FNOL timestamp, policy ID/status at loss date, coverage/peril checks, deductible, mandatory-document checklist, triage outcome. Standardised reason codes (e.g., not covered, lapsed, duplicate, below excess, incomplete info). Deduplication logic (policyholder ID + incident date + peril). Linkage to resubmissions/appeals and to complaint records for outcome tracking. Limitations and considerations: Definition variance: what counts as “prior to analysis” differs; some firms place incomplete cases in “pending info” instead of “declined,” affecting comparability.
Gaming risk: shifting cases to “withdrawn” or “pending” to improve this metric; require audit trails and age-off rules. Mix effects: products with low deductibles or mandatory documents (e.g., health) have different baseline rates—segment results.

60,119,Insurance claims rejection rate,% of all insurance claims that are rejected by insurers (post-analysis),"The claims-rejection rate shows the share of claims that an insurer declines to pay—fully or partially—relative to the total number (or value) of claims submitted in a period. Because denial directly affects customer trust and complaint volumes, supervisors use the metric to monitor fair-treatment outcomes, detect aggressive underwriting or opaque policy wording, and flag operational shortcomings such as poor documentation guidance. A sudden rise may presage reputational damage, regulatory sanctions, or litigation costs, while an unusually low rate can hint at lax fraud controls or inadequate underwriting discipline. Definitions and concepts: Claims rejected (denied): claims for which the insurer issues a final communication refusing payment on contractual grounds (e.g., policy exclusions, lapsed cover, misrepresentation) or on fraud findings. Withdrawn claims initiated by the policy-holder are normally excluded. Partial rejections: if only part of a claim (e.g., an excluded add-on) is denied, firms disclose “partial acceptance” separately or prorate the amount. Segmentation: line of business (motor, health, property), distribution channel, and claim cause allow root-cause diagnostics. Data requirements: Claims-management records containing claim identifier, receipt date, decision date, decision outcome (accepted / partial / rejected), rejection reason code, and claimed amount. Policy data (coverage type, inception date, exclusions) to corroborate eligibility. Complaint and dispute registers to reconcile re-opened or overturned denials. Reinsurance flags to ensure ceded claims are not double-counted. Limitations and considerations: Definition divergence: Some regimes class “claims closed without payment” (due to missing documents) as rejections; others record them as pending, complicating cross-market comparison. Fraud vs. technical denial: Combining fraud rejections with contractual exclusions can blur very different risk issues—separate reporting is best practice. Volume vs. value: A single large, legitimately denied loss can distort amount-based ratios; analysts should monitor both count and value metrics.
Appeals and reversals: Denials overturned on review lower true rejection rates; timely data updates are essential.

57,120,Insurance policy renewal (persistency) ratio,% of all policies up for renewal that are renewed,"The renewal- or persistency-ratio gauges the proportion of in-force insurance policies (or premium) that remain active after a specified period—typically the 13th, 25th, or 61st month following issuance. High persistency signals strong customer satisfaction, effective servicing, and accurate underwriting assumptions; it underpins stable cash-flow projections, lowers acquisition-cost amortisation strain, and enhances embedded value. Conversely, rapid lapses erode fee income, accelerate reserve releases, and may expose product-design weaknesses or mis-selling. Supervisors review persistency alongside surrender-value payouts and complaint levels to detect conduct-risk or solvency concerns. Definitions and concepts: Persistency ratio (policy-count basis) = Policies renewed at month t / Policies eligible for renewal at month t
Premium-weighted persistency uses renewal premium divided by original premium to capture face-amount shifts. Cohort vs. calendar method: Cohort traces a single issue-year block through time; calendar aggregates all cohorts renewing in a given period. Relevant events: lapse (non-payment without value), surrender (voluntary termination with cash value), and paid-up conversion (premium holiday but reduced benefit) are typically treated as non-persistent. Data requirements: Policy-level records: issue date, premium mode, product type, distribution channel, grace-period status. Billing and collection feed to flag premium receipts by due date. Adjustments for reinstatements, partial surrenders, and top-ups to ensure consistent numerator/denominator treatment. Historical lapse assumptions embedded in pricing models for benchmark comparison.
Limitations and considerations: Measurement horizon: 13-month persistency suits annual-premium life products; short-tailed general-insurance policies need annual retention ratios. Basis differences: Premium-weighted ratios reward upsells and mask partial lapses; policy-count ratios may over-penalise low-value term covers. Seasonality & campaigns: Year-end discount drives can spike renewals, overstating structural persistency. External shocks: Macro downturns or regulatory fee caps can depress renewal rates; trend interpretation should control for such factors.

A higher reinstatement rate can indicate effective retention outreach and product value to customers; very low rates may signal affordability stress, weak follow-up, or poor customer experience. From a risk perspective, reinstatements affect cash flows, reserve dynamics, and anti-selection (customers may reinstate when risk has increased). Pair this indicator with persistency, tenure of cancellations, and complaint metrics to diagnose retention quality and customer outcomes. Definitions and concepts: Lapse (non-payment): policy terminated after the grace period due to unpaid premium (distinct from surrender, maturity, or death). Reinstatement: restoration of coverage after lapse once back-premiums (and any interest/fees) are paid and underwriting/administrative conditions are met. Coverage may be backdated or resume prospectively per policy terms. Measurement window: define a fixed look-back (e.g., reinstated within 90/180 days of lapse).

196,122,Surrendered insurance policies,% of eligible insurance policies (or policyholders) de-activated/lapsed that paid-out surrender values,"This indicator shows the share of terminated policies that generated a cash surrender payout. It helps distinguish benign expiries or non-cash lapses from value-bearing exits that can strain liquidity, depress embedded value, and signal product-fit or conduct issues (e.g., early surrenders after aggressive sales). Supervisors and boards use it to gauge customer outcomes, the health of savings-type books, and potential mis-selling or affordability problems. Definitions and concepts: Eligible policy: contracts with a cash value (e.g., whole life, endowment, unit-linked). Pure risk covers (term, many GI lines) are ineligible. Surrender vs. lapse: a surrender pays cash value on termination; a lapse ends cover without payout. De-activatd here excludes natural maturaties and deaths. Full vs. partial surrender: count full surrenders tied to termination; report partial withdrawals separately unless they trigger de-activation.
Indicator (count basis): Policies terminated in period with a surrender payout divided by the number of eligible policies terminated (non-maturity) in period.

195,123,Tenure of cancelled insurance policies,"Average time between policy activation and cancellation, by chosen time periods (e.g., <3 months, 3-6 months, 6-12 months, etc)","This indicator captures how long policies stay in force before they are cancelled (or lapse mid-term). A concentration of early-tenure cancellations is a red flag for mis-selling, poor onboarding, pricing/friction issues, or product-fit problems. It also matters for economics: early lapses strand acquisition costs, depress embedded value, and erode persistency. Tracking tenure by product and channel helps target remediation (e.g., agent training, cooling-off disclosures, claim-time communications). Definitions and concepts: Cancellation: termination of cover before the natural renewal/expiry date—may be customer-initiated (voluntary), insurer-initiated (non-payment, underwriting, fraud), or regulatory. Activation (policy start): the in-force date (not the issue date, if different). Tenure (days/months) = cancellation date – activation date.
Buckets: choose stable, business-meaningful bands (e.g., <3m, 3–6m, 6–12m, 12–24m, >24m). Report count-weighted and premium-weighted shares. Scope: life and non-life; clarify whether non-renewals at anniversary are counted (usually not) and how cooling-off/free-look rescissions are treated (often reported separately). Data requirements Policy-level fields: policy ID, product/LOB, distribution channel, activation date, cancellation date, cancellation reason code, written premium/sum assured, payment mode, and claim history. Status logic to exclude simple expiries and to de-duplicate reinstated policies (see below). Calendar and cohort views (by issue month/quarter) to remove seasonality. Limitations and considerations: Selection bias: averaging only cancelled policies ignores still-active ones. For a fuller view of lifetime behaviour, complement with survival analysis (e.g., Kaplan–Meier) and standard persistency ratios (13/25/61-month). Reinstatements: define whether a reinstated policy’s earlier cancellation is (a) ignored, (b) treated as a separate episode, or (c) measured to the first cancellation only.
Reason codes matter: split results (voluntary, non-payment, underwriting, fraud). Early non-payment suggests billing/channel issues; early voluntary points to product fit. Channel & product mix: bancassurance, digital, and agency books have distinct early-tenure profiles—always segment.

239,148,Customer complaints (number),"Number of customer complaints (including processing status, channels, type)","This indicator tallies the formal expressions of dissatisfaction that retail or MSME clients lodge with a financial-service provider (or an external ombudsman) about products, services, or staff conduct over a specified period and can be normalized by dividing by the customer basis to obtain an intensity metric (e.g. complains per 1,000 active customers). A rising complaint count can signal service-quality gaps, mis-selling, opaque fees, or inadequate disclosure—issues that erode trust and may escalate into regulatory sanctions or litigation. Supervisors can track both the absolute number and complaint-to-account ratios to test consumer-protection frameworks, prioritise thematic reviews, and assess whether rapid product roll-outs (e.g., digital lending, mobile wallets) are being matched by robust after-sales support. Where granular data or more detailed reporting templates permit, customer complaints can be disaggregated by processing status (e.g. open, in-process, resolved, rejected), product (e.g. consumer loan, deposit account, etc), channel (e.g. digital, phone, in-person), issue category (e.g. fraudulent or unauthorized transactions, unfair treatment, unexpected fees, errors on statements,  etc.), closure status (open, resolved with monetary compensation, resolved without compensation, excalated to ombudsman/regulator, withdrwan) or resolution status (e.g. favorably solved vs. rejected). Combined with resolution-time, compensation and other metrics, the number of customer complaints provides a critical, early-warning lens on conduct risk and customer-experience health. Definitions and concepts:  Complaints are expressions of dissatisfaction by (or on behalf of) customers that are related to their experiences with FSPs and can include any written, digital or recorded verbal statement made through any available channel, such as a branch, call-centre, email, social media, chatbots and other portals. Complaints may relate to the quality of a product or service, treatment by an FSP (including its agents and other third parties), or suspected wrongdoing. Complaints are different from general inquiries (e.g., where can I find an ATM?) or legal disputes between parties that may require formal dispute resolution. For more information, see for example CGAP's toolkit on using complaints data for market conduct supervision: https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/market-monitoring-tool-analysis-complaints-data and the Alliance for Financial Inclusion's framework on 'Complaint handling in Central Banks': https://www.afi-global.org/sites/default/files/publications/2020-04/AFI_CEMC_framework_AW_digital%20v2.pdf. Data requirements:  Database or log of customer complaints, detailing date of complaint and additional information, such as channel through which complaint was lodged, associated product or account, details or brief description of the complaint, and resolution status. Limitations and considerations: Complaints processes differ across FSPs in terms of steps/levels for routing, hand-over, escalations to higher management levels and to external ombudsman. Customer details and demographics of complainants are not always capture/stored on FSPs' systems, or may be stored in fragmented data bases. Complaints logged at aggregator sites/portals may not request customer demographics. Limited to officially logged complaints and/or maintaining records of inbound customer communications. Dependent on having electronic complaints management system.  Reporting culture: firms with easy‐to‐use channels may record more complaints than peers, even if service quality is similar—benchmark using severity and uphold rates. Under-reporting bias: vulnerable customers may forgo formal complaints; mystery-shopping and survey data can complement administrative counts. Duplicate cases: the same issue voiced through multiple channels can inflate totals unless robust deduplication exists. Product mix effects: complaint propensity varies—e.g., complex investments draw more grievances than basic savings; segment analysis is essential. Regulatory divergence: definitions and mandatory reporting thresholds differ across jurisdictions, complicating cross-border comparisons.",individual and MSME,yes,volume,"How does the number of complaints at each processing stage vary by gender?

243,149,Customer complaints resolved in the last period,% of customer complaints that were solved in the customers' favor in the most recent period,"This indicator shows the share of complaints closed in the reference period that were resolved in the customer’s favor. It is a direct outcome metric for fair treatment and service quality. A higher “uphold rate” can indicate strong remediation and customer-centric policies; a very low rate may suggest poor triage, overly narrow eligibility rules, or weak guidance to customers on evidence requirements. Supervisors use it to benchmark conduct outcomes across firms and products; boards track it alongside complaint volumes and resolution times to target root-cause fixes. Tracked with complaint volume, resolution time, and compensation totals, this indicator provides a balanced view of consumer outcomes and conduct risk. Definitions and concepts: Resolved in the customer’s favor (upheld): final decision grants redress—monetary (refund/compensation/fee reversal) or non-monetary (policy correction, contract change, apology with tangible remedy). Many firms also count partially upheld cases; disclose whether partials are included. Denominator: all complaints closed in the period (not those merely received). Segment results by product, channel, and severtiy to avoid masking problem areas. Data requirements: Central complaint-management records with unique IDs, receipt date, closure date, product, channel, allegation type, decision outcome (upheld/partially/declined), and compensation amount. Deduplication logic across channels; linkages to ombudsman/regulator portals for escalations and reversals. Customer-base denominator (for intensity metrics) and service level agreement (SLA) timestamps for parallel monitoring* (see note below). Limitations and considerations: Classification discretion: definitions of “partial uphold” vary; publish inclusion rules. Case mix effects: a surge in low-merit mass claims can depress the percentage; report severity-adjusted or line-of-business cuts. Gaming risk: chasing high uphold rates may encourage paying weak claims; pair with fraud flags, root-cause fixes, and cost-per-case. Timing bias: complex cases close later and differ in uphold propensity; use rolling averages and track median resolution time. External outcomes: include overturned-on-appeal adjustments to reflect true customer outcome. *With granular time-stamped complaints data, timeliness of key milestones in the complaints resolution process can be tracked, for example time to acknowledge complaint, time to first response, time to resolution. With this data, supervisors can track not just outcomes, but also whether providers are meeting required timeframes per their own SLA.

Regulators track both the frequency and severity (e.g., service-unavailable minutes, customers affected, monetary losses) to judge the resilience of payment, trading, and customer-service channels. A rising trend can erode confidence, trigger supervisory remediation, and expose the system to contagion if multiple firms rely on the same outsourced provider or infrastructure.
Definitions and concepts: Operational disruption incident: an unplanned event that prevents or materially degrades the delivery of a critical business service beyond a defined tolerance (see Basel Principles for Operational Resilience, EU DORA, FFIEC guidelines).
Critical service: any activity whose prolonged unavailability could threaten safety and soundness or financial-stability objectives (e.g., real-time gross settlement, internet banking, card authorisation).
Impact metrics: duration, peak concurrent users affected, transaction backlog, financial loss, data-integrity impact, customer detriment.
Root-cause categories: hardware/software failure, cyber-intrusion, third-party outage, human error, environmental event. Data requirements: Internal incident logs with timestamps, incident IDs, systems affected, impact metrics, and remedial actions; Service-level monitoring data (uptime, latency) for validation; Post-incident reviews and root-cause analyses; External data feeds on utility outages or cyber threat intelligence to correlate systemic events. Limitations and considerations: Reporting thresholds vary: Some jurisdictions require notification only for incidents exceeding specific customer or duration thresholds, complicating cross-country comparison. Under-reporting incentives: Firms may fear reputational damage; robust audit trails and supervisory reviews are needed to assure completeness.Heterogeneous critical-service definitions: A mobile-banking outage at a digital-first bank may be classified as “critical,” whereas a similar disruption at a wholesale-only institution might not.

High prepayment activity can squeeze interest income on fixed-rate portfolios, change expected cash-flow profiles that underpin asset-liability management, and distort credit-loss models that assume stable amortisation. For lenders, rising early payoffs may flag aggressive refinancing campaigns by competitors, interest-rate declines that make refinancing attractive, or borrowers’ improved liquidity. Supervisors and investors monitor the metric to evaluate interest-rate risk, pipeline hedging effectiveness, and revenue volatility, especially in mortgage and consumer-credit books.

190,92,Borrowers in debt counselling and rehabilitation,% of borrowers participating in debt counselling and/or debt rehabilitation progams,"This indicator tracks the prevalence of individuals formally enrolled in debt-counselling or rehabilitation programmes: legal or contractual processes that restructure debt, impose spending plans, or provide financial-literacy support. A rising level signals household over-indebtedness pressures, tighter monetary or labour-market conditions, or aggressive credit expansion in the recent past. Regulators, consumer-protection agencies, and lenders track the metric to gauge systemic consumer-credit risk, calibrate responsible-lending rules, and anticipate write-off or provisioning needs. Definitions and concepts: Borrowers refers to resident individuals that have obtained any type of credit from financial institutions. Individuals are counted as one borrower, irrespective of the number of loan accounts held. Debt-counselling / debt-review: A court-sanctioned or regulator-approved process (e.g., South Africa’s National Credit Act, UK Debt Management Plans) where a certified counsellor assesses affordability, negotiates new payment schedules with all creditors, and disburses consolidated instalments. Debt rehabilitation / discharge: The stage at which the borrower has completed the plan, obtained a clearance certificate, or been legally discharged from remaining obligations (analogous to Chapter 13 completion in the US). Indicator forms:
Stock measure: number of active borrowers under counselling ÷ total number of retail borrowers. Flow measure: new counselling entrants during the period ÷ new defaults. Data requirements: Registry or court filings identifying unique borrowers, start and end dates, original and restructured debt balances, and counsellor accreditation. Credit-bureau data to link counselling status with credit scores, delinquency buckets, and new credit enquiries. Limitations and considerations: Coverage gaps: Informal or NGO-led advice services may not report centrally, understating prevalence. Regime differences: Some jurisdictions treat insolvency, debt management, and bankruptcy as separate processes; harmonising counts is non-trivial. Multiple enrolments: Borrowers can exit and re-enter counselling; deduplicating unique individuals is essential for accurate stock figures. Moral-hazard concerns: Easy access to rehabilitation might weaken repayment discipline; analysts pair this indicator with post-rehabilitation re-default rates.Privacy restrictions: Personally identifiable data are often masked, limiting segmentation by income, gender, or geography unless aggregated extracts are provided. Used alongside delinquency trends, restructuring volumes, and loan-loss provisions, the “borrowers in debt counselling and rehabilitation” metric offers a forward-looking lens on household financial stress and the effectiveness of consumer-protection frameworks.",individual,no,volume,How do the percentages of borrowers in debt counseling or rehabilitation compare by gender?

This indicator measures aggregate flows of international remittances in both volume (number of remittances received and sent) and value (amount of money received and sent) using the country's financial insfrastructure.

Definitions and concepts: Deposit accounts include transaction and non-transaction deposit accounts, for example: Checking/demand, savings, time/term deposit accounts, pensions. This is a core indicator in the IMF Financial Access Survey which collects financial access and usage indicators from 192 economies, for a number of financial institution types, enabling cross-country comparisons and benchmarking (https://data.imf.org/en/datasets/IMF.STA:FAS). Data requirements: Total number of unique deposit account holders (i.e. an individual or MSME must be counted as one depositor irrespective of the number of deposit accounts held) at the end of a specified period (e.g. quarter or year); Total number of adults (counts from recent census or estimates from national statistics agency).  Limitations and considerations: If individuals or MSMEs own deposit accounts across multiple different financial institutions, sector or system wide aggregates which add up accounts across institutions will, as a result, overstate the degree of financial inclusion unless granular data and unique national IDs can be used to identify individuals with multiple accounts across financial institutions.

339,10,Deposit accounts (number),Number of deposits accounts,"The indicator tallies all active deposit accounts—current, savings, time, and other interest-bearing or transactional accounts—held at regulated financial institutions. At a system level it acts as a proxy for financial inclusion and the depth of retail intermediation: more accounts usually mean broader access to formal payments, savings, and safety nets. Sudden growth may signal successful inclusion policies—or, alternatively, aggressive promotional campaigns that inflate dormant or low-balance accounts. Contractions can foreshadow confidence losses, digital-wallet substitution, or macro-economic stress. Definitions and concepts: Deposit accounts are any liability account accepting customer funds repayable on demand or at maturity, protected (wholly or partly) by deposit insurance, they include transaction and non-transaction deposit accounts, for example: Checking/demand, savings, time/term deposit accounts, pensions. This is a core indicator in the IMF Financial Access Survey which collects financial access and usage indicators from 192 economies, for a number of financial institution types, enabling cross-country comparisons and benchmarking (https://data.imf.org/en/datasets/IMF.STA:FAS). Data requirements: Core-banking extracts listing unique account numbers, product codes, opening/closing dates, ownership type, currency, and last-activity timestamp. Limitations and considerations: Multiple accounts per person: high counts do not always equal high inclusion; adults often hold several accounts across banks—complement with unique account holders where possible. Dormancy rules: inconsistent activity windows distort cross-bank and cross-country comparisons; transparent “active” definitions are critical.

340,11,Deposit accounts (outstanding balance),Value (outstanding balances) of deposit accounts,"This indicator totals the outstanding balances—principal plus accrued but unpaid interest—across all active deposit accounts held at regulated financial institutions at a given reporting date. The figure reveals the size of the banking system’s core funding base, the stock of household and MSME sector savings, and the portion of the money supply sitting in deposit form among these sectors. A rising balance can reflect healthy income growth, successful financial-inclusion efforts, flight-to-safety behaviour, or accommodative monetary policy; a sharp decline may foreshadow liquidity stress, disintermediation into higher-yield instruments, or confidence shocks. Supervisors track the metric to test funding-gap ratios, calibrate deposit-insurance funds, and monitor the transmission of interest-rate moves to retail savers. Definitions and concepts: Outstanding balance: book value of customer liabilities on the reporting date, including accrued interest but excluding yet-to-post interest for the current period. Deposit types: demand/current, savings, time/fixed-term, notice, and negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW) accounts. Some jurisdictions also include e-money float ring-fenced in banks. Gross vs. net of reserve requirements: analyses should specify whether statutory reserve deductions have been netted out. Segmentation: resident vs. non-resident, retail vs. wholesale, insured vs. uninsured—each slice carries different run-off characteristics in a stress scenario. Data requirements: End-of-day core-banking ledger extracts with account number, product code, currency, balance, and customer sector. Mapping tables to consolidate subsidiaries and eliminate interbank or affiliate deposits. FX rates for translating foreign-currency accounts into a common reporting currency. Historical time series to assess growth trends and seasonality. Limitations and considerations: 4 Multiple counting: interbank placements and pass-through agent balances can inflate totals if not stripped out. FX volatility: large foreign-currency books can distort trends when exchange rates swing; constant-currency views help. Dormant or legally blocked funds: balances in frozen or deceased-estate accounts add to the stock but are not immediately withdrawable. Seasonality: corporate tax dates and bonus seasons cause predictable spikes and dips—use moving averages for structural analysis.

When expressed as a share of the population, or in per capita terms, it is a measure of the prevalence of borrowing. Definitions and concepts: Borrowers refers to resident individuals or MSMEs that have obtained any type of credit from financial institutions. Individuals or MSMEs are counted as one borrower, irrespective of the number of loan accounts held. Data requirements: Unique borrowers with an open loan account at the end of a specific period (e.g. month, quarter or year.); For computing borrowers per capita or percent of adults that borrow from financial institutions, need total adult population (official count from census or estimates from national statistics agency). Limitations and considerations: If individuals are using loans from multiple financial institutions,  sector or system-wide aggregates, may count the same borrower more than once and therefore overstate the number of unique borrowers unless a unique national ID can be used to track individual borrowers across institutions. Additional requirements and/or operations for key disaggregations:  (A) By type of credit: For each unique borrower, a list of open loan accounts  at the end of a specific period (e.g. month, quarter or year). From this list, obtain the number of open loan accounts for each mutually exclusive credit type category relevant to the local context  (e.g. mortgage, credit card, personal loan, other revolving credit, etc), with a 0 if loan from category is not in use. The percentage of borrowers using at least one loan account for each credit category can then be computed.  (B) By loan size: The objective here is to assign all unique borrowers to a reduced set of loan size categories, for example the percentage of borrowers with loan sizes between (a) 0-10 USD, (b) 10-50 USD, (c) 50-100 USD, (d) 100-1000 USD, (e) 1000+ USD.

The loan-level list can be aggregated to a borrower-level list by computing the average loan size per borrower; (C) By interest rate bands: This segmentations provides a summary of the distribution of borrowers by the interest rates attached to their loans, for a specific financial institution or the wider financial system, and require granular data or data system to produce: (1) A list of all active unique loans disbursed during a specific period of time, detailing the  interest rate (APR), (2) Loan-level data should be linkable to a unique customer ID in order to identify all the loans that are currently active per borrower. The loan-level list can be aggregated to a borrower-level list by computing the average APR per borrower (potentially using a weighted average using the loan size as the weight); (D) By credit type: This segmentation can provide measures of the relative prevalence of usage of broad credit types in the financial system.  This segmentation requires that for each unique borrower, a list of open loan accounts  at the end of a specific period (e.g. month, quarter or year) with additional detail available on the number of open loan accounts for each mutually exclusive credit type category relevant to the local context  (e.g. mortgage, credit card, personal loan, other revolving credit, etc), with a 0 if loan from category is not in use.

Supervisors, exchanges, and policymakers follow the metric because a broad retail base diversifies funding sources, deepens market liquidity, and helps democratise wealth creation, yet it can also heighten conduct-risk and volatility when inexperienced investors herd into speculative assets. Sudden surges (e.g., during low-rate or “meme-stock” periods) may strain market infrastructure and prompt reviews of disclosure, leverage caps, and investor-protection rules. Definitions and concepts: Retail investor: a natural person trading on their own account; excludes professional clients and qualified counterparties under MiFID II, and often excludes high-net-worth individuals who meet professional criteria. Head-count measure – unique retail accounts or individuals registered with brokers/central depositories. Activity measure – percentage of total equity or ETF turnover, order count, or IPO allocation attributable to retail. Penetration rate – retail investor head-count ÷ adult population (or working-age population). Demographic segmentation: age, gender, income, and digital-channel uptake reveal inclusiveness and potential vulnerability pockets. Data requirements: Brokerage and trading-platform account registries (deduplicated for multi-broker relationships). Exchange order-flow tagging (retail vs. institutional) captured via participant codes or regulatory client identifiers.
Central Securities Depository (CSD) shareholder lists for direct-holding models. Investor surveys to gauge unrecorded indirect holdings (mutual funds, pension wrappers).

Indirect exposure: retail ownership via funds is sizeable yet invisible in brokerage data, understating true household market exposure.
Data-protection barriers: privacy laws can restrict sharing of client-level identifiers, complicating cross-broker aggregation.

144,48,Cost of remittances,Average cost of receiving and sending remittances,"Remittances are an important source of external financing in many countries around the world and support the well-being of migrant families as well as broader development as remittances provide greater opportunities, for savings, consumption and investment. Lowering the transaction costs of remittances matters because it means greater savings for remitters or more income for receiving family members. This indicator measures the financial cost of sending and receiving remittances using the country's financial insfrastructure and can be benchmarked against international averages, for example using the World Bank's remittance prices worldwide reports (https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org). Definitions and concepts: Money remittances are payment services where funds are received from a payer, without any payment accounts being created in the name of the payer or the payee, for the sole purpose of transferring a corresponding amount to a payee or to another institution offering payment services that is acting on behalf of the payee, and/or where such funds are received on behalf of and made available to the payee. These could be inflow transactions into an account, but many remittances will not land into accounts, but rather be withdrawn in cash via a money remitter, a mobile money agent or a bank branch (Committe on Payment and Settlement Systems red book: https://www.bis.org/cpmi/glossary_030301.pdf?). Data requirements: This indicator can be constructed using current listed prices or data already being reported to regulators to identify, for example, the cost of sending and receiving USD 200 by for each remittance service provider type (Bank, Money transfer operators, Mobile money operators, Post Offices) and for a specified set of remittance corridors that make up the dominant share of remittance corrditors. A simple average can be used (e.g. the average cost of sending 200 USD across all regulated banks) or weighting the listed prices by the volume or value of transactions flowing through each corridor if that data is available by reporting institution. Alternatively, this indicators can be constructed using transaction-level data to identify all remittance transactions made by customers that have been executed during a specific period of time, and taking an overall average or a weighted average by remittance corridor . This indicator is usually expressed as percentage of the value of the remittance being sent or received.",individual,no,value,"What are the gender patterns in remittance costs for sending and receiving transactions?

Overlaying the geographic distribution accountholders on the geographic distribution of transaction points (e.g. ATMs, agents, POS) can help identify locations with deficits in transaction infrastructure. Definitions and concepts: Transaction accounts are broadly defined as an account held with a bank or other authorised and/or regulated service provider (including a non-bank) which can be used to make and receive payments. Transaction accounts can be further differentiated into deposit transaction accounts and e-money accounts, including mobile money accounts. An account holder is a unique individual or MSME that has at least one transaction account. An individual or MSE must be counted as one account holder irrespective of the number of accounts held. Data requirements: (1) List of transaction account holders geo-located to their residence at a primary or secondary subnational administrative area, (2) Number of cash-in/cash-out financial access points for each administrative unit at the selected sub-national level, (3) Total adult population (or surface area) for each administative unit at the selected sub-national level.

Overlaying the geographic distribution of transaction accounts on the geographic distribution of cash circulation can help to better understand the demand for and use of accounts. Definitions and concepts: Transaction accounts are broadly defined as an account held with a bank or other authorised and/or regulated service provider (including a non-bank) which can be used to make and receive payments. Transaction accounts can be further differentiated into deposit transaction accounts and e-money accounts, including mobile money accounts. While the overall supply of cash is determined by monetary policy that influences the level of currency in circulation, demand for cash concerns how the population chooses to spread currency across different activities, including (1) legal payments, (2) cash savings and (3) other transactions involving cash for use abroad, corruption or tax avoidance (https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2023/03/17/Measurement-and-Use-of-Cash-by-Half-the-Worlds-Population-531077). The demand for cash can be proxied by the aggregate volume of cash withdrawals. Inactive (or dormant) accounts refers to an account that has not been used to conduct transactions (e.g. deposits, withdrawals, transfers) over a long period of time prior to a specific reference date (e.g. one year). Passive transactions such as interest deposits are usually excluded. Data requirements: (1) List of inactive transaction accounts geo-located to the residence of the account owner at a primary or secondary subnational administrative area, (2) Proxy for demand for cash: E.g.  total cash withdrawals over a specified period for each administrative unit at the sleected sub-national level, (3) Total adult population (or surface area) at selected subnational administrative area. This indicator requires first computing the intensity of cash circulation in each subnational area in per-capita or km2 terms and defining a threshold above which the area is considered to have a high density of access points.

6,66,Financial system credit operations,Volume and value of credit operations in the total financial sector portfolio,"This indicator captures the breadth of formal lending with two perspectives: the number of credit contracts (volume) and their aggregate outstanding balance (value) across all regulated financial-service providers—commercial banks, development banks, credit cooperatives, microfinance institutions, finance companies, and regulated fintech lenders. Tracking it offers a panoramic view of credit intermediation, enabling supervisors to (i) gauge financial deepening, (ii) assess systemic leverage, (iii) monitor shifts in portfolio composition (e.g., rise of consumer or SME lending), and (iv) feed macro-prudential stress tests and monetary-policy models. Sharp expansions may indicate rapid financial inclusion or, conversely, overheating; contractions can herald credit crunches that dampen growth. Definitions and concepts: Credit operation – any legally binding loan, line of credit, hire-purchase, lease, or other receivable on the balance sheet of a regulated lender. Off-balance-sheet commitments (e.g., undrawn credit lines, guarantees) are usually excluded or reported separately. Volume (count): unique loan contracts outstanding at the reporting date; renewals/extensions count as new operations if a fresh contract is signed.
Value (stock): gross carrying amount before provisions, converted to a common currency for consolidation. Segmentation by sector (household, corporate, government), product type, currency, and residual maturity enriches analysis. Regulated FSPs – entities licensed and supervised under banking, cooperative, or specialized-credit legislation; shadow lenders fall outside scope unless specifically captured.Data requirements: Supervisory returns or call-reports detailing loan-book balances and contract count by institution and product. Standardised product and sector taxononies to avoid double counting. FX rates for translating foreign-currency portfolios. Institution identifiers to consolidate groups and branches. Historical series for seasonality and growth-rate calculations. Limitations and considerations: Coverage gaps: Unregulated peer-to-peer, informal lenders, and trade credit remain invisible, understating true credit supply. Double counting: Syndicated loans and on-lending between regulated entities can inflate aggregates unless netted. Valuation differences: IFRS amortised-cost figures versus local-GAAP gross amounts may hinder inter-institution comparability; harmonised reporting templates are essential. FX volatility: Currency swings affect value trends; analysts should present both nominal and constant-currency series. Contract granularity: Large corporate facilities can dwarf thousands of microloans—pairing volume and value prevents misinterpretation. Interpretation therefore benefits from complementary indicators (loan-to-GDP ratio, sectoral growth rates, NPLs) to paint a balanced picture of credit-market health and systemic risk.",individual and MSME,yes,volume and value,"How is participation in the total credit portfolio evolving by customer income, location and gender, both for individuals and MSMEs considering the gender of their owners?

27,89,Borrowers in risky indebtedness (risk of over-indebtedness),"Number of borrowers classified as at risk of over-indebtedness, as per risk-indebtedness calculation","Tracking over-indebtedness gives authorities an early warning of systemic stress: when large segments of borrowers can’t meet their obligations, loan-loss provisions, bank solvency, and overall financial stability come under pressure. It also highlights consumer-protection gaps—persistent debt burdens signal predatory lending or inadequate affordability assessments—allowing regulators to calibrate prudential rules and market-conduct supervision to prevent crises before they materialize. This particular indicator that identifies borrowers at risk of overindebtedness was develeoped by the Central Bank of Brazil: https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/cidadaniafinanceira/documentos_cidadania/serie_cidadania/serie_cidadania_financeira_8_endividamento_risco_2ed.pdf ad https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376634051_Risky_Indebtedness_Behavior_Impacts_on_Financial_Preparation_for_Retirement_and_Perceived_Financial_Well-Being and is a composite of four component indicator as described below. Definitions and concepts: A borrower is flagged as being in ""risky indebtedness"" when any two of the following four criteria are met: (1) Has defaulted on credit installments, that is, has had payment delays of more than 90 days in meeting credit obligations, (2) Monthly income devoted to debt-service payments exceeds 50 percent, (3) Has simultaneous exposure to the following forms of credit: overdraft, unsecured personal loan, and revolving credit card debt, (4) Monthly disposable income (after debt-service payments) that falls below the poverty line. Data requirements: List of unique borrowers; Full loan level credit (repayment) history linkable to each unique borrower; Personal income. Limitations and considerations: Generating this indicator at the system level requires a unique national ID in order to match loans from all regulated FSPs to unique borrowers. The indicator also requires access to income data, which may be available in some cases from tax authorities or other government agencies. Derivable indicators: Percent of borrowers in risky indebtendess; Percent of adults in risky indebtedness.

181,98,Revenue generated by unsecured credit,% of total topline revenue attributable to unsecured credit operations and interest and non-interest revenue proportions,"This indicator captures the total income that a lending institution earns from unsecured credit products—credit cards, personal instalment loans, overdrafts, payday and buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) facilities—over a reporting period. Because unsecured lending is typically high-yield and high-risk, tracking its revenue helps supervisors and management understand how much of the institution’s top line depends on products that are more sensitive to economic downturns, job-market shocks and aggressive competition. A rising share can boost short-term profitability, but it may also presage higher future credit losses and conduct-risk concerns if underwriting standards slip. Definitions and concepts: Unsecured credit – loans that are not backed by collateral; repayment relies on the borrower’s cash flow and creditworthiness.
Revenue components – Interest income (accrued and collected) from outstanding balances. Fee income: annual fees, origination fees, late-payment charges, interchange on card transactions, BNPL merchant discount rates. Net insurance or payment-protection premiums (if bundled) may be included subject to local accounting rules.
Revenue share metric: Unsecured-credit revenue ÷ Total lending revenue expresses concentration risk. Risk-adjusted yield – revenue net of credit-loss provisions gives a clearer view of economic profitability. Data requirements: Product-level general-ledger extracts segregating interest, fees and other income. Loan-level flags identifying collateral status (secured vs. unsecured). Average daily or month-end balances to compute effective yields. Associated credit-loss provisions and write-offs for risk-adjusted analysis. Limitations and considerations: Mixed products: Some personal loans are partially secured (e.g., salary-linked) or carry optional collateral; clear taxonomy is essential. Fee recognition rules: Capitalised origination fees amortised under effective-interest-rate (EIR) accounting may blur timing comparisons across banks or jurisdictions. Regulatory caps: Interest-rate or fee ceilings (e.g., usury limits) affect revenue potential and comparability. Promotional pricing: Introductory 0 % card offers or BNPL “pay-in-4” models generate deferred revenue; headline figures may understate future income. Economic cyclicality: Unsecured-credit revenue can fall sharply in recessions as balances contract and charge-offs rise; pairing with delinquency and provision metrics is crucial for a full risk-return picture.",individual and MSME,no,value,"What proportion of total topline revenue comes from unsecured credit operations, and are there gender disparities in this distribution?

122,124,Cost of reinsurance,Premiums ceded to reinsurers as % of claims paid by reinsurers and reinsurance commissions,"The cost of reinsurance indicator quantifies the price an insurer pays to transfer part of its underwriting risk to reinsurers. Tracked as either an absolute expense or as a ratio—most often Reinsurance premium ceded ÷ Gross premiums written (GPW)—it shows how much earnings capacity the company surrenders for balance-sheet protection. Rising costs may stem from hardening global reinsurance markets, higher catastrophe exposures, deteriorating loss experience or weakened cedant credit quality. Supervisors and rating agencies watch the metric because excessive reliance on expensive cover can compress margins, while under-spending may leave the insurer over-exposed to shocks. Definitions and concepts: Reinsurance premium ceded: contractual payments (net of commissions) made to reinsurers for proportional (quota-share, surplus) or non-proportional (excess-of-loss, stop-loss) treaties, booked at treaty inception. Net cost of reinsurance: ceded premium minus ceding commission plus profit-commission adjustments and reinstatement premiums. Cost ratio variants:
Ceded-premium ratio—ceded premium ÷ GPW (gross view).
Net cost ratio—(ceded premium – commissions) ÷ Net premiums written (NPW). Market cycle: “soft” markets feature ample capacity and lower prices; “hard” markets follow major loss years, tightening terms and pushing up the indicator. Data requirements: Treaty schedules detailing ceded premium, ceding commissions, profit-commission formulas, reinstatement terms and capacity limits. Gross and net premium registers by line of business for denominator consistency. Historical loss data and catastrophe-model outputs to link pricing shifts to risk profile. Currency breakdown to isolate FX effects on multi-currency programmes. Limitations and considerations: Treaty mix effects: A pivot from quota-share to excess-of-loss lowers ceded premiums but might raise reinstatement costs in a bad year; headline ratios should be analysed alongside retention curves. Timing mismatches: Premiums are typically paid up-front, while recoveries occur post-loss, so annual cost ratios can spike in growth years and dip after large events. Ceding commissions: High fronted commissions on quota-share deals can obscure the true net cost; analysts should focus on post-commission cash flows. Counter-party credit risk: Cheap cover from low-rated reinsurers may understate economic cost once collateral requirements or credit-risk capital charges are considered.Regulatory capital offsets: Some jurisdictions grant solvency credit for risk transfer only if treaties meet strict risk-transfer tests; fail-points can turn apparent cost savings into capital drains. Evaluated over time and in tandem with retention ratios, loss experience and solvency coverage, the cost-of-reinsurance indicator reveals whether an insurer’s risk-transfer strategy is prudent, affordable and sustainable.",N/A,no,value,How are FSP gender diversity and the gender composition of the customer base correlated with costs incurred with reinsurance?,*MicroPru: Solvency,Insurance,"Quality of financial services

114,125,Risk retention ratio (dependency on reinsurance),% of gross written premium that is net (as a measure of the level of dependency on reinsurance),"Also known as the net retention ratio or risk retention ratio, this indicator shows the proportion of insurance risk an insurer keeps on its own balance sheet after ceding portions to reinsurers. It is usually expressed as Net premiums written ÷ Gross premiums written, or, for claims, Net incurred claims ÷ Gross incurred claims. A high ratio signals greater self-reliance (and potentially higher earnings volatility), while a low ratio points to heavy dependence on reinsurance, which may reduce earnings swings but create counter-party and availability risks. Supervisors monitor the metric to ensure that ceded volumes are commensurate with the insurer’s capital strength, product mix, and risk appetite, and to detect excessive outward reinsurance that might mask under-capitalisation. Definitions and concepts: Gross premiums written (GPW): Total premium income before reinsurance ceded.
Net premiums written (NPW): GPW minus premiums ceded plus reinsurance recoveries on ceded unearned premiums.
Retention strategy: the targeted share of each risk or line that the company keeps. Common variations include quota-share, surplus, excess-of-loss, and stop-loss treaties, each affecting retention differently across severity and frequency layers. Counter-party credit risk: reliance on reinsurers introduces the need to assess reinsurer financial strength and collateral arrangements. Data requirements: Line-of-business breakdown of GPW and NPW (or claims) for the period. Details of outward reinsurance treaties (type, attachment points, limits, reinstatements). Reinsurer credit ratings and collateral held (letters of credit, trusts, funds withheld). Historical loss triangles net and gross to analyse retention across cohorts. Limitations and considerations: Treaty structure nuance: A single headline ratio can conceal materially different risk profiles—e.g., low retention on catastrophe layers but high retention on attritional losses. Accounting timing: Premium recognition and profit-commission adjustments can distort period ratios, especially for multi-year treaties. Counter-party concentration: A low dependency ratio is only as strong as the reinsurer panel; high concentration risk may offset the benefits of ceding. Regulatory arbitrage: Aggressive use of finite-risk or fronting arrangements can lower apparent retention without true risk transfer; regulators scrutinise such structures under risk-transfer tests (e.g., Solvency II Article 208).

115,126,Technical provisions,Level of technical provisions to cover actuarial liabilities,"Technical provisions represent the present-value estimate of all future cash outflows that an insurer expects to incur on already-written policies, including claims not yet reported (IBNR), claims reported but not settled, and future policyholder benefits. Adequate provisions are the cornerstone of insurance solvency: if reserves are understated, an insurer may appear profitable while silently eroding its ability to meet policy obligations and regulatory capital requirements. Definitions & concepts: Technical provisions comprise two main blocks: Best-Estimate Liabilities (BEL), the probability-weighted expected value of future cash flows (claims, benefits, expenses) discounted using risk-free or prescribed curves; and Risk Margins, an additional amount reflecting the cost of holding capital to run off the liabilities (Solvency II) or a prudential margin (IFRS 17, LAT). Within BEL, Life insurers separate mathematical reserves and participation features, while Non-Life insurers distinguish Unearned Premium Reserves, Outstanding Claims Reserves, and IBNR. Discounting, inflation assumptions, lapse behaviour, and reinsurance recoverables are critical modelling inputs. Data requirements: Policy-level datasets: inception date, coverage term, sum assured, premium schedule, embedded options. Claims triangles: paid and incurred data by accident year/underwriting year for run-off analysis. Economic parameters: risk-free yield curve, inflation indices, currency basis. Experience studies: mortality, morbidity, lapse, and expense analyses to calibrate best-estimate assumptions.
Reinsurance treaties: cessions, limits, and expected recoveries. Limitations and considerations: Model risk: Heavy reliance on actuarial projections; small assumption shifts (e.g., longevity, claims inflation) can materially move liabilities. Interest-rate sensitivity: Low-rate environments inflate discounted liabilities, especially for long-duration life contracts. Regulatory divergence: Solvency II, ICS, and local GAAP use different discount curves, risk margins, and contract boundaries, hindering cross-country comparisons. Management discretion: Profit-sharing, early-settlement strategies, or reserve releases can smooth earnings but obscure underlying risk trends. Robust governance—peer reviews, back-testing, and sensitivity analysis—is essential to ensure technical provisions faithfully capture the insurer’s true obligations.",N/A,yes,value,How are FSP gender diversity and the gender composition of the customer base correlated with the level of technical provisions?,*MicroPru: Solvency,Insurance,"Quality of financial services

17,187,Deposit stability/volatility,"Stability/volatility of retail deposits (deposit stickness, deposit stability, deposit flows)","The deposit-stability (or deposit-volatility) indicator assesses how predictable a bank’s funding base is by tracking the fluctuation and “stickiness” of customer deposits over time. Sudden, correlated outflows—whether triggered by market rumours, rate competition or digital-bank runs—can force the bank to liquidate assets at fire-sale prices or draw on emergency facilities. Regulators therefore monitor deposit volatility alongside liquidity ratios to judge an institution’s ability to withstand funding shocks and to calibrate run-off assumptions in stress tests and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). Definitions & concepts: Core / stable deposits: retail or SME balances judged unlikely to flee under stress; often defined by balance size, relationship depth, and whether the account is transactional (“operational”) rather than rate-sensitive. Volatility metrics: standard deviation of daily balances divided by the mean (coefficient of variation), maximum one-day net outflow over a look-back window, or elasticity (beta) to market rates.
Deposit concentration: Herfindahl-Hirschman Index or share held by top N customers, a key driver of volatility. Behavioural run-off factors: Basel assigns 3%–10% to stable retail deposits and ≥40% to non-operational corporate deposits. Data requirements: High-frequency (daily or intraday) deposit-balance time series, tagged by customer type, product, and currency. Interest-rate history to estimate betas. Customer identifiers for relationship tenure, cross-selling, and concentration analysis. Event logs for promotional campaigns or pricing changes that may distort normal behaviour. Limitations and considerations: Window-dressing: balances can spike at quarter-end to flatter liquidity metrics.
Segmentation judgement: mis-classifying rate-sensitive deposits as “stable” understates risk. Digital-channel dynamics: mobile-app withdrawals can accelerate run speed beyond historical norms; backward-looking volatility measures may understate future risk.
Macro factors: deposit flight often correlates across banks during systemic stress, reducing diversification benefits. Hence supervisors pair volatility indicators with scenario-based outflow assumptions, contingency-funding plans, and qualitative assessments of customer behaviour to obtain a robust view of funding resilience.",N/A,no,other,Are there gender disparities in deposit stability?

120,197,Property to capital ratio,Exposure to property,"The property-to-capital ratio compares a bank’s aggregate exposure to the real-estate sector with the loss-absorbing capital available to absorb a housing-market shock. A high ratio indicates that a sizeable decline in property prices—or in borrowers’ repayment capacity—could wipe out a large share of the institution’s solvency buffer, amplifying systemic stress. Supervisors therefore use the metric to spot concentration risk, calibrate counter-cyclical capital buffers, and justify targeted underwriting limits. Definitions and concepts:  Property exposure: the on-balance-sheet book value of residential and commercial real-estate loans, loans secured by property under construction, and foreclosed real estate held for sale. Some jurisdictions add off-balance-sheet commitments (undrawn mortgage lines, guarantees) or direct equity investments in property companies.
Capital: usually Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) or Total Regulatory Capital, net of deductions. Ratio formula: Total property exposure ÷ Capital × 100 %. Segmenting into Residential Property / Capital and Commercial Property / Capital reveals which market drives concentration. Data requirements:  Loan-level or granular portfolio data tagged by collateral type and purpose (owner-occupied, buy-to-let, office, retail, etc.). Valuation data for repossessed property and construction-in-progress. Quarterly or monthly regulatory capital figures, both transitional and fully-loaded. Memoranda items on undrawn commitments to capture pipeline risk. Limitations and considerations: Classification ambiguity: mixed-use or multi-purpose facilities can be mis-classified, blurring residential versus commercial signals. Collateral valuation lags: property values are often updated infrequently; rapid price swings may make exposures appear lower than market reality. Risk-weight heterogeneity: two banks with identical ratios may hold very different risk-weighted assets if one uses internal models with lower real-estate risk weights. Macroprudential overlays: caps on loan-to-income or loan-to-value ratios can mitigate vulnerability even when the indicator is high, so it should be analysed alongside underwriting quality, provisioning coverage, and stress-test results.
Used in trend and peer analysis, the property-to-capital ratio provides an early warning of over-concentration in real-estate lending and informs both micro-prudential and macro-prudential policy actions.",N/A,no,value,How are FSP gender diversity and the gender composition of the customer base correlated with risks related to immovable assets?,"Statistics & research

117,198,ROA,Return on assets,"ROA gauges how efficiently a bank turns every unit of assets under its control into net profit. Because banks are highly leveraged, asset efficiency is a clearer performance yard-stick than raw earnings, and supervisors watch for sudden drops that can foretell solvency stress. Definitions and concepts: ROA = Net income after tax ÷ Average total assets (opening + closing assets ÷ 2). “Total assets” must reflect IFRS 9 or equivalent classifications, with loan-loss allowances netted out. Data requirements: Audited income statement (net income) and balance-sheet totals at two balance-sheet dates, preferably quarterly to smooth seasonality. For cross-bank comparability, assets should be consolidated across subsidiaries. Limitations and considerations: ROA ignores off-balance-sheet exposures such as guarantees or derivatives.
Accounting choices (fair-value vs amortised cost, tax treatments) can distort comparability across jurisdictions. Short-term spikes may stem from one-off gains; trend analysis over several periods is essential.

64,201,Suspicious transaction reports,Number of suspicious transaction reports," The indicator tallies the reports that banks, insurers, money-value transfer providers, and other reporting entities file with the national Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) when they detect activity that may involve money-laundering, terrorism financing, sanctions evasion, or related predicate offences. A rising count can signal stronger detection systems and compliance awareness, while a sudden drop may hint at control weaknesses—or, conversely, that earlier over-reporting has been corrected. Policymakers use STR volumes, in combination with disposition data (e.g., investigations, prosecutions), to gauge the health of the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) regime and to allocate investigative resources. Definitions and concepts: Suspicious Transaction Report (STR): a mandatory report filed “as soon as practicable” when a transaction is known, suspected, or has reasonable grounds to be suspected of involving criminal proceeds or terrorist funds (FATF Rec. 20). Equivalent terms include Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) in the United States. Reporting entities: broadly, all institutions covered by the AML/CFT law (banks, securities firms, casinos, DNFBPs). Objective vs. subjective STRs: some jurisdictions distinguish automated threshold-based filings (objective) from analyst-driven filings (subjective), a useful nuance for interpreting volumes. Data requirements: FIU registry of incoming STRs, ideally tagged by date, reporting institution, sector, transaction channel, predicate crime category, and outcome (e.g., disseminated to law-enforcement); Denominator data: number of active reporting entities or total transactions to derive reporting intensity metrics (STRs per 1,000 accounts, etc.). Regulatory amendments or guidance notes that may affect reporting thresholds or definitions. Limitations and considerations: Volume ≠ effectiveness: high counts may reflect defensive “over-filing,” whereas low counts in high-risk sectors can signal under-reporting. Outcome metrics (cases initiated, assets restrained) are needed for a fuller picture. Sector mix effects: Expansion of reporting obligations (e.g., to virtual-asset service providers) can inflate year-on-year totals; trend analysis should adjust for coverage changes. Data quality: Duplicate submissions, incomplete narratives, or vague suspicion reasons hamper analysis and inflate reported numbers without real value. Confidentiality constraints: Detailed, institution-level STR data are usually restricted; aggregated figures may mask significant inter-bank variation. Used judiciously alongside risk assessments, supervisory findings, and law-enforcement outcomes, the number of STRs provides a vital—but not standalone—signal of AML/CFT system performance.",individual and MSME,no,volume,"Are there gender disparities in the volume of STRs generated, including for MSMEs by the owner's gender?

65,202,Systematic reporting to financial intelligence unit/office (FIU),Number of transactions reported (excluding suspicious transaction reports) to FIU,"This indicator counts all objective anti-money-laundering (AML) disclosures that reporting institutions file with the FIU other than Suspicious Transaction Reports (STRs)—for example Cash / Large-Value Transaction Reports (CTRs/LCTRs), Cross-Border Currency Reports (CBCRs), Electronic Funds Transfer Reports (EFTIs), and threshold-based casino or dealer filings. Tracking the volume highlights how much potentially high-risk activity flows through the regulated system, tests the reach and effectiveness of automated monitoring engines, and helps the FIU size analytical workloads and allocate investigative resources. Sharp changes may flag shifts in cash-based commerce, regulatory threshold tweaks, or system-integration problems at reporting entities. When combined with STR counts and outcome statistics, this indicator offers a comprehensive perspective on the preventive arm of the AML/CFT framework and the evolving risk landscape of cash and cross-border fund flows. Definitions and concepts: Objective reports: filings triggered automatically when a transaction exceeds a statutory threshold or meets a predefined typology—irrespective of suspicion. Common examples: CTR / LCTR – cash deposits, withdrawals, or exchanges ≥ (e.g.) USD 10 000. CBCR – physical cross-border movements of currency or bearer negotiable instruments above a set limit. EFTI / International Funds Transfer Instruction (IFTI) – cross-border wire transfers over a threshold. Casino / Dealer reports – chip buy-ins or precious-metal trades over a threshold. Reporting entities: all AML-obliged institutions—banks, MSBs, securities firms, DNFBPs—must file within the statutory deadline. Denominator metrics (optional): total transactions processed or number of active customers, enabling intensity ratios. Data requirements: FIU registry of objective-report filings with unique identifiers, filing date, reporting institution, transaction value, currency, channel, and report type. Systems logs from core banking, cash counters, payment switches, and customs to validate completeness. Limitations and considerations: Threshold drift:  Policy-driven threshold changes can spike or suppress counts—trend analysis must normalise for rule changes. False positives / fragmentation: One multipart transaction may create several filings (e.g., split deposits), inflating totals; deduplication logic improves accuracy. Coverage gaps: Informal money-value transfer services outside the regulatory perimeter are invisible, understating systemic cash movements.
Data-quality variance: Missing customer identifiers or incorrect codes hinder FIU analytics; robust validation routines are essential. Workload vs. value: High volumes can overwhelm FIU resources; pairing the indicator with conversion metrics (reports that trigger investigations, prosecutions, asset seizures) provides a fuller view of effectiveness.",individual and MSME,no,volume,"Are there customer gender disparities in the volume of systematic transaction reports (transactions that are not suspicious but reach regulatory thresholds for reporting) to the FIU, including for MSMEs by the owner's gender? Is there a correlation between the volume of these reports and the composition of the FSP customer base by gender?

109,203,Tier 1 capital ratio,Tier 1 regulatory capital as % of risk weighted assets (RWAs),"The Tier 1 ratio shows the core loss-absorbing capital (CET1 + AT1) relative to risk-weighted assets (RWA). It is a cornerstone of Basel III solvency standards and a trigger point for supervisory intervention. Definitions and concepts: Tier 1 capital comprises common equity tier 1 (CET1) plus additional tier 1 (perpetual, non-cumulative instruments). RWA adjust asset values for credit, market, and operational risk weights.
Data requirements: Regulatory capital composition tables, risk-weighting calculations or model outputs, deductions (goodwill, DTAs), and supervisory approvals for internal models. Limitations and considerations: Internal-ratings-based (IRB) banks may report lower RWA than standardized peers, inflating comparability. National discretion (e.g., mortgage risk weights) can create uneven playing fields.

It informs market-risk capital and limits. Definitions and concepts: Parametric, historical, and Monte Carlo VaR methodologies vary in how they model distribution tails. Basel permits a 97.5% CVaR (expected shortfall) for FRTB; many banks still report traditional VaR in parallel. Data requirements: Time series of risk-factor prices, correlations, volatilities, portfolio position data, and back-testing results. Limitations and considerations: VaR is not additive across portfolios and ignores extreme tail events beyond the confidence level (“black swans”). Assumes normal market conditions; during crises, correlations spike and VaR underestimates risk.
