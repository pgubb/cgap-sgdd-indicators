It's typically expressed as a percentage of the higher earner gender (usually men's earnings), for a given role or hierarchical level at the financial institution. Prudential supervisors can use this indicator with a focus on the safety and soundness of financial institutions. A significant gender pay gap can be an indicator of underlying governance and operational risks. for conduct supervisors, a significant gender pay gap could be an indication of potential misconduct and unfairness that could affect customers.

120,218,Property to capital ratio,Exposure to property,"The property to capital ratio compares an entity's aggregate exposure to the real estate sector with the shock-absorbing capital. Over-exposure to real state investments could wipe out a large share of the institution’s capital in case of falling prices, or could indicate speculative investment by lenders. Used in trend and peer analysis, the property-to-capital ratio provides an early warning of over-exposure to real-estate investments and informs both micro-prudential and macro-prudential policy actions. Supervisors therefore use the metric to spot excessive exposure to real state that is not justified by core lending activities (e.g., repossed foreclosed properties).

Sharp expansions may indicate rapid financial inclusion or overheating; contractions can herald credit crunches that dampen growth. Definitions and concepts: Credit operation – any legally binding loan, line of credit, hire-purchase, lease, or other. Off-balance-sheet commitments (e.g., undrawn credit lines, guarantees) are usually excluded or reported separately. Volume (count): unique credit contracts outstanding at the reporting date; renewals/extensions count as new operations if a fresh contract is signed.

17,208,Deposit stability/volatility,"Stability/volatility of retail deposits (deposit stickness, deposit stability, deposit flows)","The deposit stability (or deposit-volatility) indicator assesses how predictable an FSP's funding base is by tracking the fluctuation and “stickiness” of customer deposits over time. Sudden, correlated outflows—whether triggered by market rumours, rate competition or digital bank runs—can force a bank to liquidate assets at fire-sale prices or draw on emergency facilities. Prudential supervisors monitor deposit volatility alongside liquidity ratios to judge an institution’s ability to withstand funding shocks and to calibrate run-off assumptions in stress tests and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). Definitions & concepts: Core / stable deposits: retail balances judged unlikely to flee under stress; often defined by balance size, relationship depth, and whether the account is transactional rather than rate-sensitive. Volatility metrics: standard deviation of daily balances divided by the mean (coefficient of variation), maximum one-day net outflow over a look-back window, or elasticity (beta) to market rates. Calculation methods vary across countries. Data requirements: High-frequency (daily or intraday) deposit-balance time series, tagged by customer type, product, and currency. Interest-rate history to estimate betas. Customer identifiers for relationship tenure, cross-selling, and concentration analysis. 
Digital channel dynamics: mobile app withdrawals can accelerate run speed beyond historical norms; backward-looking volatility measures may understate future risk.",N/A,no,other,Are there gender disparities in deposit stability?

Rising averages can reflect successful affluent-segment acquisition or rate-driven inflows; falling figures may signal disintermediation to money funds/securities or competitive pressure. Definitions and concepts: Term deposit accounts (such as certificates of deposit) are interest-bearing accounts whose funds can be withdrawn (without penalty) at the maturity date.

172,102,First-time borrowers,% of borrowers who are first-time borrowers with the FSP (or in the financial system),"This indicator shows the share of active borrowing retail customers who are new to the lender (new-to-bank/FSP) or new to formal credit altogether (new-to-credit, NTC). It is a direct barometer of financial inclusion and retail credit growth. A higher share can signal effective onboarding and market expansion, but it also shifts portfolio risk: NTC borrowers may lack repayment histories, making underwriting more model-driven and subject to greater uncertainty. Supervisors and lenders can monitor this metric to balance inclusion objectives with prudent risk management and to evaluate the effectiveness of credit-bureau coverage. Definitions and concepts: First-time borrower (FSP scope): a customer with no prior loan or credit line ever booked by the FSP before the reference period. First-time borrower (system scope / NTC): a customer with no prior loan or credit line reported to the national credit registry/bureau within a defined historical look-back (commonly “ever,” or a long horizon such as 5–10 years). This indicator is obtained by dividing the number of first-time borrowers by the total number of borrowers. Variants of this indicator include: value-weighted (by origination amount), new originations only (versus the entire active book), and cohort-based analysis (by origination month or quarter). Data requirements: Customer master records with unique, reliable identifiers (national ID/tax ID; deduplicated across branches). Loan-booking history from the FSP’s core systems. Credit-bureau/registry match results (for system-wide NTC status). Product taxonomy (include/exclude credit cards, overdrafts, BNPL) and reference dates. Limitaitons and considerations: Coverage gaps: thin or partial bureau coverage, informal lenders, or non-reporting segments can misclassify NTC status.
Identifier quality: name changes, multiple IDs, or data-entry errors cause false “first-time” flags; robust deduplication is essential.

Definitions and concepts: A payroll loan (also called a payroll-deducted loan, salary loan) is a personal consumer loan whose installments are automatically withheld from the borrower’s pay-check (or pension/social-security benefit) and remitted directly to the lender each pay period. Because repayment is taken “off the top” of the employee’s gross salary, the borrower’s future income effectively serves as collateral, giving lenders high repayment certainty and allowing them to charge lower rates than on unsecured personal loans.

This indicator is a vital sign of a platform's effectiveness, credibility, and the overall health of its ecosystem. It helps gauge the ability of a platform to connect viable projects with interested backers. For MSMEs, crowdfunding can be a viable and less onerous funding source, so the indicator provids important information for monitoring development of MSME finance markets. From a market conduct perspective, while a high success rate is generally positive, an unusually high or artificially inflated rate could be a red flag for misconduct. Platforms could be setting trivially low funding goals to boost statistics,  failing to conduct proper due diligence on projects, or not being transparent about how the success rate is calculated.

Supervisors examine the indicator alongside NPL and provisioning coverage to judge whether lenders are recognising losses promptly or postponing them through restructurings. Definitions and concepts: Write-offs ratio is usually expressed as (Gross retail loan write-offs during period ÷ Average gross retail loans outstanding). Write-off: an accounting action that derecognises the unrecoverable portion of a loan’s amortised cost. It does not preclude further collections, which are recognised as recoveries.

56,142,Insurance claims (loss) ratio,% of total premium income paid out as claims,"The claims paid ratio compares the amount of benefits and claims an insurer actually disburses during a period with the premium income it records for the same portfolio. It answers a basic question for supervisors, policy-holders, and analysts: How much of each premium dollar flows back to customers in the form of claims? Persistently low ratios may flag overly aggressive pricing, onerous exclusions, or servicing bottlenecks, while very high ratios can foreshadow reserve inadequacy, under-pricing, or a spike in catastrophe losses. In combination with the expense ratio, the indicator feeds into the overall loss or combined ratio that underpins solvency and profitability assessments. Definitions and concepts: Claims paid: cash actually settled with policy-holders and claimants in the accounting period, including partial payments and salvage recoveries netted where local GAAP allows. It excludes outstanding claims reserves and IBNR, which are captured by “claims incurred.” Gross vs. net basis: gross claims ignore reinsurance recoveries; net claims deduct them, better reflecting the insurer’s retained risk. Segmented ratios (e.g., motor, health, property) pinpoint product-level profitability. Data requirements: Extracts from the claims-management system showing paid amounts, dates, line of business, and reinsurance cessions. Premium registers (written or earned, depending on supervisory preference) reconciled to the general ledger. Catastrophe tags, legal-settlement flags, and large-loss registers to isolate one-off distortions. Limitations & considerations: Timing mismatch: annual premiums are often received up-front, whereas claim payments can lag; using earned premiums mitigates, but does not eliminate, this distortion. Claims-handling practices: delayed settlement or dispute escalation depresses the ratio without improving true risk experience. Reinsurance structure: quota-share vs. excess-of-loss treaties change the net ratio dramatically; analysts should review both gross and net perspectives. Regulatory definitions: some jurisdictions fold surrenders of savings-type contracts into claims, inflating comparability.

57,149,Insurance policy renewal (persistency) ratio,% of all policies up for renewal that are renewed,"The renewal- or persistency-ratio gauges the proportion of in-force insurance policies (or premium) that remain active after a specified period—typically the 13th, 25th, or 61st month following issuance. High persistency signals strong customer satisfaction, effective servicing, and accurate underwriting assumptions; it underpins stable cash-flow projections, lowers acquisition-cost amortisation strain, and enhances embedded value. Conversely, rapid lapses may expose product-design weaknesses or mis-selling. Supervisors review persistency alongside surrender-value payouts and complaint levels to detect conduct risk and solvency concerns. Definitions and concepts: Persistency ratio (policy-count basis) = Policies renewed at month t / Policies eligible for renewal at month t
Premium-weighted persistency uses renewal premium divided by original premium to capture face-amount shifts. Cohort vs. calendar method: Cohort traces a single issue-year block through time; calendar aggregates all cohorts renewing in a given period.

22,117,Non performing loans (NPLs) in the retail portfolio,Non performing loans rate in the retail loan portfolio,"The NPL indicator for the retail loan portfolio quantifies the share (or absolute value) of consumer and MSE loans that are unlikely to be fully repaid. Because retail credit typically involves high volumes of granular, often unsecured exposures, a build-up of NPLs signals mounting credit risk costs, pressure on provisioning, and potential stress. Supervisors track this metric to assess lenders' underwriting standards, resilience to economic shocks, and the effectiveness of arrears management. Definitions and concepts: An NPL is defined as a loan that is past-due for a minimum amount of days (e.g., 90 days). The definition can vary across countries but the Basel Committee has set common standards. The retail portfolio encompasses exposures to individuals and qualifying MSMEs treated under the retail asset class. The most common ratio is Gross NPLs ÷ Gross retail loans. Aggressive charge-offs or “evergreening” can temporarily lower the NPL ratio without improving underlying asset quality.

A rising stock signals mounting credit stress, latent loss risk, or even internal frauds or mismagement. While restructurings can help viable borrowers bridge a temporary shock, they may defer recognition of non-performing loans (NPLs). Supervisors watch both the level and the flow of restructurings to detect “ever-greening”. Definitions and concepts: Restructured (or renegotiated / forborne) loan: an exposure whose cash-flow terms have been modified for credit risk reasons and would not have been granted under comparable market conditions. Local definitions vary, while standard setting bodies such as the Basel Committe and IFRS have provided common standards. Indicator formula: Restructured loans ÷ Gross loans (stock measure). Limitations and considerations: Regulatory divergence: Some jurisdictions treat any concession as a restructuring; others exclude purely administrative changes, hampering cross-country comparisons.

Rising early-stage arrears are an early-warning signal of household stress and of future spikes in non-performing loans (NPLs), provisions and write-offs.

Supervisors and risk managers use the metric to test the effectiveness of underwriting standards, consumer disclosure, customer interfaces (for digital loans), and pricing for credit risk. Definitions and concepts: Loan delinquency refers to a situation in which borrowed money is not paid back as agreed. A loan becomes delinquent when a borrower misses a regular installment payment. A delinquent loan is any kind of loan that has past due payments but has yet to go into default. On a value basis, this indicator measures the total outstanding balances past due (for example greater than 1 day past due) as a share of gross retail loan balances at the end of a specified period.

267,125,Interest rate spreads (loans),Difference between the average lending rate and a reference rate (e.g. deposit rate or external reference rate),"The interest-rate spread on loans captures the margin between the average contractual rate a lender charges borrowers and an external reference rate—typically the policy rate. It is a concise gauge of (i) lenders’ credit-risk pricing, (ii) competitive conditions in the lending market, and (iii) monetary-policy transmission. Wider spreads may reflect higher perceived borrower risk, limited competition, or funding-cost pressures; persistently narrow spreads can point to aggressive underwriting or excess liquidity that may undermine future asset quality.

162,64,Account closure costs paid by customers,Average customer-paid account closure charges ,"This indicator captures the out-of-pocket costs borne by customers when they close their transaction account(s). It focuses on fees directly tied to the closure process (not ongoing usage fees). High averages or wide dispersion can signal unfair fee structures, poor process design (e.g., costly payout rails), or weak disclosures—issues that draw conduct-risk scrutiny and harm inclusion goals. Tracking this metric alongside complaints upheld about closure, time to close, and payout failure/return rates gives a rounded view of off-boarding fairness and efficiency. Definitions and concepts: Transaction accounts are broadly defined as an account held with a bank or other authorised and/or regulated service provider (including a non-bank) which can be used to make and receive payments. Transaction accounts can be further differentiated into deposit transaction accounts and e-money accounts. Customer-paid closure charges: amounts debited to the customer because of closure, including: explicit closure fees, final statement/document fees, card/cheque deactivation fees, balance-refund/payout charges (e.g., wire/RTGS, cheque issuance, e-money cash-out), account package early-termination fees, statutory taxes/levies linked to these items, and FX/transfer margins if required to remit funds. Exclusions: regular monthly maintenance already charged prior to the closure request, penalty interest on unrelated lending, and third-party fees not passed through. Data requirements: Event log with closure request date and closure completion date; customer ID (deduplicated), number of accounts closed, channel, reason code. Transaction-level fee taxonomy to flag closure-related charges; payout transactions (method, amount, fees, FX). Reversal/waiver flags and timestamps to net back rescinded charges. Recommended charge window: from request date through T+30 days after completion to catch settlement/payout fees. Number of customers who closed at least 1 account in period. Limitations and considerations: Attribution: define the fee list upfront to avoid counting routine usage fees; publish the measurement window.",individual,yes,value,"How do the average costs for account closures compare by gender?

32,184,Product portability requests,Number of product portability requests,"Measures the volume of formal requests initiated by customers to transfer their financial product or relationship from one provider to another within a specific period. This includes activities like switching a mortgage, transferring a loan to a new lender, or moving a current account to a new bank. This indicator is a gauge of market competition, consumer empowerment, and potential frictions or risks within the financial system. Very low switching rates can indicate significant barriers to entry or anti-competitive behavior, suggesting that customers are ""trapped"" with their current providers due to high exit fees, complex processes, or a lack of clear alternatives. This indicator is even more important in countries where product switching platforms or open finance exist and whose effectiveness should be monitored. A companion indicator to the total number of product switch requests is the total number of switches effected in the period, in comparison to the total number of requests. Another companion indicator is the total number of requests (or successful requests) relative to the number of active customers. The central bank of Brazil has calculated the number of loan portability requests relative to the number of loans with an interest rate above the market average rates, using the number of loans with above-market interest rates as a proxy for the untapped potential of the portability system. https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/publicacoes/Documents/reb/boxesreb2020/boxe_2_evolucao_portabilidade_credito_brasil.pdf",individual and MSME,no,volume,"Are there customer gender, income and location disparities in account and loan portability or FSP switching requests?

This indicator can be used in countries where there is a private pension fund adminsitration industry, but not in countries where the entirety of the pension system is publicly-funded.

61,146,Insurance policy downgrade rate,"% of policies downgraded at the customer's request (e.g.,  lower coverage, higher deductiblees, removal of riders, switch to a lower tier plan)","This indicator tracks the share of in-force policies that customers voluntarily reduce in coverage during the period. Elevated downgrade activity can signal affordability stress, product misfit, or competitive pressure (customers trading down to cheaper plans). It affects revenue (lower premiums), risk mix (higher deductibles shift loss ratios), and persistency (downgrades may precede lapses or surrenders). Supervisors and boards use the metric to monitor customer outcomes and pricing adequacy, and to gauge the effectiveness of retention strategies that preserve cover while easing budgets. Definitions and concepts: Downgrade (customer-initiated): a mid-term endorsement or renewal change that reduces coverage level—e.g., lower sum assured/benefit limits, higher deductibles/co-pays, downgrade of plan tier. Formula (count basis): # policies with customer-requested downgrades in period divided by # active (or renewing) policies in period.

285,129,Debt service-to-income ratio,% of income allocated to retail credit debt repayment ,"The debt service-to-Income ratio,  sometimes referred to more concisely as the debt service ratio (DSR) expresses a borrower’s (or household’s) total debt-service burden relative to recurring income, answering a simple question: How much of each income unit is already pledged to repay existing debt? At the micro level, lenders use DSR to assess repayment capacity, price credit, and comply with responsible-lending rules. At the macro level, supervisors track average or distributional DSR to gauge household vulnerability to interest-rate shocks and to calibrate macro-prudential tools such as loan-to-income caps. Definitions and concepts: Debt payments include principal, interest, mandatory insurance on retail credit facilities;  Income can be defined in gross terms (pre-tax income (salary) plus verifiable recurring earning) or net terms (income after taxes and social-security contributions). Data requirements: Current loan statements or credit-bureau/registry reports detailing payment amounts, remaiming term, and interest rate for all obligations; Recent payslips, audited financial statements (self-fmployed), tax returns, and verified rental or pension income. Limitations and considerations: Income volatility: informal or gig-economy or commission-based earnings make future cash flows uncertain; Undisclosed liabilities: informal or unreported debts escape bureau coverage, understating true DSR. Household composition: shared living expenses and co-borrower support can distort individual ratios; some frameworks use household disposable income instead. Interest-rate path: fixed-rate loans keep payments stable, while floating-rate debt can raise DSR sharply when policy rates rise. Cross-country comparability: tax structures, social-welfare benefits, and healthcare costs influence disposable income, so identical DSR thresholds may imply different real affordability across jurisdictions.",individual,no,value,"How do debt service-to-income ratios vary by gender and across different loan sizes and terms?

158,55,Inactive and dormant accounts (balance),% of total account balances that are held in inactive and dormant accounts,"This indicator shows the share of funds sitting in deposit and payment accounts (excluding term deposits) that are not actively used by customers. High concentrations of idle balances can signal weak customer engagement, poor product fit, or frictions in account usage—important for financial-inclusion quality, liquidity management, and conduct risk. From a prudential angle, large dormant balances may look “stable” but can reverse if reactivation drives or policy changes prompt withdrawals. For consumer protection, persistent dormancy raises risks around unclaimed funds, fees, and fraud. Recommended to analyze of this indicator by product type (e.g. current/checking, mobile money, etc). Definitions and concepts: Accounts: demand/current accounts and other payment-capable deposit accounts. Inactive account: no customer-initiated debit/credit (card use, cash withdrawal/deposit, transfer) for a defined window (e.g., ≥90 or 180 days). System entries (interest, fees, bank corrections) don’t count. Dormant account: extended inactivity beyond a longer threshold (commonly ≥12 months) that may trigger special handling (restricted access, outreach, escheatment). Indicator formula: Balances in inactive + dormant transaction accounts divided by total transaction-account balances. Reporting the split (inactive vs. dormant) can provide further detail. Data requirements: Core-banking ledger with end-of-day balances, product codes, and last customer-initiated activity timestamp per account. Classification rules reflecting local definitions (inactive/dormant thresholds; treatment of standing orders/auto-debits). Ownership segment (retail/SME), currency, and insured/uninsured flags. Optional: outreach attempts, reactivation outcomes, and fee assessments to monitor conduct risk. Limitations & considerations: Definition divergence: thresholds and what counts as “activity” vary by jurisdiction and even by institution—state methodology clearly. Data quality: some channels (agents, fintech front-ends) may not update the core “last activity” field, overstating dormancy.
Seasonality & cycles: balances can spike around payroll/tax periods; use consistent month-end or averages.

161,60,Revenue from inactive and dormant accounts,Average non-interest revenue earned on inactive and dormant accounts per account holder,"This indicator estimates how much fee income a provider earns, on average, from customers whose transaction accounts are inactive or dormant. It highlights potential conduct-risk hotspots (“junk fees”), tests whether inclusion policies translate into active use, and helps gauge earnings reliance on non-usage charges. Regulators often scrutinize such revenue because it may disproportionately affect vulnerable or low-balance customers and can conflict with fair-treatment principles or local dormancy rules. Used alongside % balances in inactive/dormant accounts, reactivation rates, and complaints upheld about fees, this metric provides a balanced view of inclusion quality and earnings fairness. Definitions and concepts: Inactive account: no customer-initiated transaction over a defined window (e.g., ≥90/180 days). Dormant account: extended inactivity (e.g., ≥12 months) triggering special handling (restricted access, outreach, or escheatment). Non-interest revenue: maintenance/inactivity fees, SMS/statement charges, card fees, ATM/network fees, account closure fees—exclude interest, FX spreads, and lending-related fees. Metric (per holder): Avg. fee per inactive/dormant holder = [Non interest fees charged to inactive+dormant accounts in period (net of waivers/refunds)] divided by unique customers with ≥1 inactive or dormant account in period. Report per-account as a companion view, and show inactive vs dormant separately. Data requirements: Core-banking extracts: account status, last customer-initiated activity timestamp, balances, product code. General-ledger fee income by fee code with identifiers to tie fees to specific accounts/customers; flags for waivers/refunds/chargebacks. Customer master data to deduplicate holders with multiple accounts. Policy tables: inactivity/dormancy thresholds, fee schedules, and escheatment rules; time-at-risk (days classified as inactive/dormant). Limitations and considerations: Definition variance: thresholds and what counts as “activity” differ—state methodology. Partial-period bias: accounts turning dormant late in the period face fewer fee days; consider normalizing by days inactive/dormant. Outliers & distribution: averages can be skewed; also report median, 90th percentile, and % of affected customers. Conduct/regulatory constraints: some jurisdictions cap or ban dormancy fees or require fee cessation before escheatment—track compliance and annotate series breaks after rule changes.

197,150,Reinstatement of lapsed insurance policies,% of lapsed insurance policies that have been re-instated after customer made back-payments,"This indicator shows the share of policies that lapsed for non-payment and were later reinstated after the customer cleared arrears (and, where required, satisfied evidence-of-insurability). A higher reinstatement rate can indicate effective retention outreach and product value to customers; very low rates may signal affordability stress, weak follow-up, or poor customer experience. From a risk perspective, reinstatements affect cash flows, reserve dynamics, and anti-selection (customers may reinstate when risk has increased). Pair this indicator with persistency, tenure of cancellations, and complaint metrics to diagnose retention quality and customer outcomes. Definitions and concepts: Lapse (non-payment): policy terminated after the grace period due to unpaid premium (distinct from surrender, maturity, or death). Reinstatement: restoration of coverage after lapse once back-premiums (and any interest/fees) are paid and underwriting/administrative conditions are met. Coverage may be backdated or resume prospectively per policy terms. Measurement window: define a fixed look-back (e.g., reinstated within 90/180 days of lapse). Formula (cohort basis): # policies that lapsed in period and were reinstated within {days} divided by the # policies that lapsed in period. Variants: policyholder-level (deduplicated), premium-weighted share, and calendar-period “reinstatements ÷ lapses” with a stated window. Data requirements: Policy-level: product/LOB, activation date, lapse date, grace-period end, arrears amount, reinstatement date, back-payment amount, underwriting outcome (medical/financial), and whether coverage backdated. Channel, geography, tenure at lapse, and prior claims/loan status. Cohort tags (issue or lapse month) for like-for-like tracking. Limitations and considerations: Window sensitivity: longer window raises the rate; disclose and keep constant. Classification noise: grace-period statuses mis-tagged as lapses depress apparent reinstatement. Anti-selection: reinstated policies may have higher subsequent claims—monitor post-reinstatement loss experience.

196,151,Surrendered insurance policies,% of eligible insurance policies (or policyholders) de-activated/lapsed that paid-out surrender values,"This indicator shows the share of terminated policies that generated a cash surrender payout. It helps distinguish benign expiries or non-cash lapses from value-bearing exits that can strain liquidity, depress embedded value, and signal product-fit or conduct issues (e.g., early surrenders after aggressive sales). Supervisors and boards use it to gauge customer outcomes, the health of savings-type books, and potential mis-selling or affordability problems. Definitions and concepts: Eligible policy: contracts with a cash value (e.g., whole life, endowment, unit-linked). Pure risk covers (term, many GI lines) are ineligible. Surrender vs. lapse: a surrender pays cash value on termination; a lapse ends cover without payout. De-activatd here excludes natural maturaties and deaths. Full vs. partial surrender: count full surrenders tied to termination; report partial withdrawals separately unless they trigger de-activation.
Indicator (count basis): Policies terminated in period with a surrender payout divided by the number of eligible policies terminated (non-maturity) in period. Variants: policyholder-based (unique customers), and amount-based (surrender amounts ÷ cash values of terminated policies). Segment by tenure (<1y, 1–3y, >3y), product, and channel. Data requirements
Policy-level: product type, activation date, termination date, termination reason, eligibility flag, sum assured/premium basis, accumulated cash value. Payout records: surrender amount, charges/penalties, payment date, partial-withdrawal flags. Linkages for policyholder-level deduplication and channel identification (agent, bancassurance, direct). Cohort tags (issue year/quarter) for like-for-like comparisons. Limitations and considerations: Scope errors: misclassifying ineligible policies or counting maturities/death claims inflates the ratio. Early-tenure bias & charges: lock-ins and surrender penalties may suppress payouts despite cancellations—an outcome worth reporting separately. Reinstatements & policy loans: define treatment; loan offsets can reduce observed payout without changing customer exit.

195,152,Tenure of cancelled insurance policies,"Average time between policy activation and cancellation, by chosen time periods (e.g., <3 months, 3-6 months, 6-12 months, etc)","This indicator captures how long policies stay in force before they are cancelled (or lapse mid-term). A concentration of early-tenure cancellations is a red flag for mis-selling, poor onboarding, pricing/friction issues, or product-fit problems. It also matters for economics: early lapses strand acquisition costs, depress embedded value, and erode persistency. Tracking tenure by product and channel helps target remediation (e.g., agent training, cooling-off disclosures, claim-time communications). Definitions and concepts: Cancellation: termination of cover before the natural renewal/expiry date—may be customer-initiated (voluntary), insurer-initiated (non-payment, underwriting, fraud), or regulatory. Activation (policy start): the in-force date (not the issue date, if different). Tenure (days/months) = cancellation date – activation date.
Buckets: choose stable, business-meaningful bands (e.g., <3m, 3–6m, 6–12m, 12–24m, >24m). Report count-weighted and premium-weighted shares. Scope: life and non-life; clarify whether non-renewals at anniversary are counted (usually not) and how cooling-off/free-look rescissions are treated (often reported separately). Data requirements Policy-level fields: policy ID, product/LOB, distribution channel, activation date, cancellation date, cancellation reason code, written premium/sum assured, payment mode, and claim history. Status logic to exclude simple expiries and to de-duplicate reinstated policies (see below). Calendar and cohort views (by issue month/quarter) to remove seasonality. Limitations and considerations: Selection bias: averaging only cancelled policies ignores still-active ones. For a fuller view of lifetime behaviour, complement with survival analysis (e.g., Kaplan–Meier) and standard persistency ratios (13/25/61-month). Reinstatements: define whether a reinstated policy’s earlier cancellation is (a) ignored, (b) treated as a separate episode, or (c) measured to the first cancellation only.
Reason codes matter: split results (voluntary, non-payment, underwriting, fraud). Early non-payment suggests billing/channel issues; early voluntary points to product fit.

Physical security incidents include events such as armed robberies, thefts, assaults, vandalism, or damage to property occurring at branches, ATMs, cash-in-transit vehicles, or other service delivery points. The “number of customers affected” reflects individuals who have experienced harm, loss, or disruption of service as a result of these events.This indicator measures the operational risk exposure of the financial sector to physical threats and criminal activity, and the extent to which such incidents impact customers and public trust. It forms part of the broader construct of operational resilience and consumer protection, providing insights into the safety of physical access points within the financial system. Supervisory reporting could record:
Number of incidents = Total count of reported physical security incidents during the reference period (e.g., quarterly or annually). Number of customers affected = Total number of customers who suffered loss, injury, or service disruption due to those incidents.

A high intake-decline rate can point to unclear policy wording, poor customer guidance, data-capture frictions, or overly strict gatekeeping. It is a key conduct-risk and customer-experience signal and, operationally, helps size avoidable workload versus genuinely assessable claims. Claim logged / FNOL: the moment a policyholder submits a claim or loss notice. Declined at intake (non-acceptance): the insurer refuses to open an assessable claim before investigation (e.g., policy not in force, peril not covered, waiting period, duplicate claim, claim below deductible/threshold, incomplete mandatory data not cured within a set window). Indicator formula (count basis): # claims declined at intake in period divided by # claim notifications received in period . Variants: exclude cured cases later resubmitted; report by product/channel. Data requirements: Claims-intake system fields: FNOL timestamp, policy ID/status at loss date, coverage/peril checks, deductible, mandatory-document checklist, triage outcome. Standardised reason codes (e.g., not covered, lapsed, duplicate, below excess, incomplete info). Deduplication logic (policyholder ID + incident date + peril). Linkage to resubmissions/appeals and to complaint records for outcome tracking. Limitations and considerations: Definition variance: what counts as “prior to analysis” differs; some firms place incomplete cases in “pending info” instead of “declined,” affecting comparability.
Gaming risk: shifting cases to “withdrawn” or “pending” to improve this metric; require audit trails and age-off rules. Mix effects: products with low deductibles or mandatory documents (e.g., health) have different baseline rates—segment results.

284,112,Annual percentage rate (APR) for retail credit,"Average cost of borrowing money, including fees to get the loan, as a% of the loan principal (except for credit cards)","APR is the standardized annualized cost of borrowing that incorporates the contractual interest rate plus certain up-front or periodic fees required to obtain and maintain the credit. It lets consumers compare offers across lenders and products on a like-for-like basis, and helps supervisors monitor pricing fairness and market competitiveness. Unlike a simple “nominal” rate, APR reflects timing of cash flows and required charges, so it better approximates the true price of credit. Definitions and concepts: Installment credit APR (actuarial method): the internal rate of return (IRR) that equates the amount advanced to the borrower with the present value of all required payments (principal, interest, and included fees), expressed on an annual basis.
Revolving credit APR (cards/overdrafts): the periodic rate applied to the average daily balance, annualized (e.g., daily rate × 365 or monthly rate × 12), plus disclosure of any mandatory fees as prescribed. Scope of fees: typically includes origination/processing fees and compulsory charges; excludes penalty fees and optional add-ons (unless mandated). APR vs. EIR: APR is a consumer disclosure metric (jurisdiction-specific rules); EIR is an accounting yield used to recognize interest income.Data requirements: Contract terms: principal advanced, repayment schedule (dates/amounts), nominal rate, compounding frequency, and variable-rate index/margins. Included fees: origination/processing, mandatory maintenance or platform fees, financed vs. paid-in-cash. For revolving products: periodic rate(s), balance computation method (average daily balance), mandatory annual fees, grace-period rules, promotional/teaser rates.
Use a simple or weighted average (for example, using the  loan size as a weight) to estimate the typical lender or system-wide APR. Limitations and considerations: Jurisdictional differences: which fees are included and how revolving behavior is modeled vary (e.g., US Reg Z vs. EU APRC), hindering cross-country comparisons. Behavioral assumptions: APR for revolving credit depends on assumed utilization/repayment; real costs may differ with early payoff or persistent balances.
Promotions & step-ups: teaser or deferred-interest offers can make snapshot APRs unrepresentative—show lifetime-effective examples when possible.

It answers: How many currency units of revenue did the lender earn for each 100 units of average unpaid balance? Rising values may reflect higher base rates, heavier fee reliance (e.g., late/over-limit charges), or a shift toward shorter-tenor/high-yield products; falling values can indicate competitive pressure, promotional pricing, or relief programs. Boards, supervisors, and consumer-protection teams use it to benchmark pricing fairness, earnings quality, and sensitivity to interest-rate cycles. Definitions and concepts: Recommended numerator (topline revenue, P&L-recognized): Interest income (EIR basis) + contractual fees (origination, servicing) + penalty/default interest actually recognized + punitive fees (late, over-limit, returned-payment) − waivers/reversals. Denominator: Average outstanding unsecured retail balances (use Average Daily Balance - ADB).

Because unsecured credit often targets price-sensitive segments and carries higher risk-based interest rates, excessive PAFs can materially raise the all-in cost of borrowing, undermine affordability tests, and trigger consumer-protection scrutiny. Tracking the ratio helps regulators detect predatory pricing, compare lenders’ transparency practices, and gauge competition in loan-origination services. For lenders, it is a barometer of non-interest revenue reliance and a lever for recouping acquisition costs. Processing & Application Fees (PAF): any non-refundable charge levied at or before disbursement for administrative tasks (credit checks, KYC, documentation, platform usage). Late-payment or insurance fees are excluded.
PAF ratio (simple): [Total PAF charged/Gross loan principal]×100%
Where multiple partial disbursements occur, use the aggregate principal amount. Annualised impact: when PAFs are capitalised into the Effective Annual Percentage Rate (APR), their weight declines as term length rises—monitor both absolute and APR-embedded views. Data requirements: Loan-level records capturing principal, disbursement date, PAF amount, and any rebates for cancellations. Product codes distinguishing personal instalment loans, credit-card cash advances, payday/BNPL equivalents. Borrower demographics and channel identifiers (branch, mobile app, marketplace) for segmentation. Accounting entries showing whether fees are recognised up-front (IFRS 15 “contract costs”) or amortised via the effective-interest-rate (EIR) method. Limitations and considerations: Amortisation differences: Lenders using EIR spread PAFs over the loan’s life; comparing ratios on a cash basis versus amortised income can mislead. Bundled products: Cross-selling (e.g., credit-life insurance) may shift income from PAF to commissions, understating the ratio. Regulatory caps & disclosures: Jurisdictions with fee ceilings or mandatory APR disclosures compress PAF ratios; cross-country benchmarking must control for such rules. Loan term effects: Short-tenor payday or BNPL loans show high PAF percentages even when absolute fees are small; interpret in context of maturity profile and APR.

It is a direct yard-stick of operational efficiency and customer experience. Shorter turnaround times (TATs) enhance policy-holder trust, limit reputational risk, and can lower claims handling expenses. Supervisors use the metric to enforce fair-treatment rules, while actuaries and underwriters link it to reserving accuracy—prolonged settlement can signal documentation bottlenecks, fraud investigations, policy transparency issues, or catastrophic complexity that may keep outstanding reserves elevated. Definitions and concepts:  Start point – the timestamp when the insurer first receives the claim request. End point – the date the insurer issues full payment, partial final payment, or a written denial. Average turnaround time (TAT) – arithmetic mean; many firms also monitor median and 90th-percentile to limit outlier masking.
Segmented TATs – tracked by line of business, claim severity band, and distribution channel to isolate problem areas.

60,148,Insurance claims rejection rate,% of all insurance claims that are rejected by insurers (post-analysis),"The claims rejection rate shows the share of claims that an insurer declines to pay—fully or partially—relative to the total number (or value) of claims submitted in a period. Because denial directly affects customer trust, supervisors use the metric to monitor fair treatment outcomes, detect aggressive underwriting or opaque policy wording, and flag operational shortcomings. A sudden rise may presage reputational damage, regulatory sanctions, or litigation costs, while an unusually low rate can hint at lax fraud controls or inadequate claims processing. Definitions and concepts: Claims rejected (denied): claims for which the insurer issues a final communication refusing payment on contractual grounds (e.g., policy exclusions, lapsed cover, misrepresentation) or on fraud findings. Limitations and considerations: Definition divergence: Some regimes class “claims closed without payment” (due to missing documents) as rejections; others record them as pending, complicating cross-market comparison. Fraud vs. technical denial: Combining fraud rejections with contractual exclusions can blur very different issues. Separate reporting is best practice. Volume vs. value: A single large, legitimately denied loss can distort amount-based ratios; analysts should monitor both count and value metrics.
Appeals and reversals: Denials overturned on review lower true rejection rates; timely data updates are essential.

239,178,Customer complaints (number),"Number of customer complaints (including processing status, channels, type)","This indicator tallies the formal expressions of dissatisfaction that retail or MSME clients lodge with a financial-service provider (or an external ombudsman) about products, services, or staff conduct over a specified period and can be normalized by dividing by the customer basis to obtain an intensity metric (e.g. complaints per 1,000 active customers). A rising complaint count can signal service-quality gaps, mis-selling, opaque fees, or inadequate disclosure—issues that erode trust and may escalate into regulatory sanctions or litigation. Supervisors can track both the absolute number and complaint-to-account ratios to test consumer-protection frameworks, prioritise thematic reviews, and assess whether rapid product roll-outs (e.g., digital lending, mobile wallets) are being matched by robust after-sales support. Where granular data or more detailed reporting templates permit, customer complaints can be disaggregated by processing status (e.g. received, accepted/rejected, in process, resolved, escalated/disputed, withdrawn), product (e.g. consumer loan, deposit account, etc), channel (e.g. digital, phone, in-person), issue category (e.g. fraudulent or unauthorized transactions, unfair treatment, unexpected fees, errors on statements,  etc.), resolution status (open, resolved with monetary compensation, resolved without compensation, escalated to ombudsman/regulator, other). Combined with resolution-time, compensation and other metrics, the number of customer complaints provides a critical, early-warning lens on conduct risk and customer-experience health. Definitions and concepts:  Complaints are expressions of dissatisfaction by (or on behalf of) customers that are related to their experiences with FSPs and can include any written, digital or recorded verbal statement made through any available channel, such as a branch, call-centre, email, social media, chatbots and other portals. Complaints may relate to the quality of a product or service, treatment by an FSP (including its agents and other third parties), or suspected wrongdoing. Complaints are different from general inquiries (e.g., where can I find an ATM?) or legal disputes between parties that may require formal dispute resolution. For more information, see for example CGAP's toolkit on using complaints data for market conduct supervision: https://www.cgap.org/research/publication/market-monitoring-tool-analysis-complaints-data and the Alliance for Financial Inclusion's framework on 'Complaint handling in Central Banks': https://www.afi-global.org/sites/default/files/publications/2020-04/AFI_CEMC_framework_AW_digital%20v2.pdf. Data requirements:  Database or log of customer complaints, detailing date of complaint and additional information, such as channel through which complaint was lodged, associated product or account, details or brief description of the complaint, and resolution status. Limitations and considerations: Complaints processes differ across FSPs in terms of steps/levels for routing, hand-over, escalations to higher management levels and to external ombudsman. Customer details and demographics of complainants are not always capture/stored on FSPs' systems, or may be stored in fragmented data bases. Complaints logged at aggregator sites/portals may not request customer demographics. Limited to officially logged complaints and/or maintaining records of inbound customer communications. Dependent on having electronic complaints management system.  Reporting culture: firms with easy‐to‐use channels may record more complaints than peers, even if service quality is similar—benchmark using severity and uphold rates. Under-reporting bias: vulnerable customers may forgo formal complaints; mystery-shopping and survey data can complement administrative counts. Duplicate cases: the same issue voiced through multiple channels can inflate totals unless robust deduplication exists. Product mix effects: complaint propensity varies—e.g., complex investments draw more grievances than basic savings; segment analysis is essential. Regulatory divergence: definitions and mandatory reporting thresholds differ across jurisdictions, complicating cross-border comparisons.",individual and MSME,yes,volume,"How does the number of complaints at each processing stage vary by gender?

243,179,Customer complaints resolved in the customer's favor,% of customer complaints that were solved in the customer's favor in the most recent period,"This indicator shows the share of complaints closed in the reference period that were resolved in the customer’s favor. It is a direct outcome metric for fair treatment and service quality. A higher “uphold rate” can indicate strong remediation and customer-centric policies; a very low rate may suggest poor triage, overly narrow eligibility rules, or weak guidance to customers on evidence requirements. Supervisors use it to benchmark conduct outcomes across firms and products; boards track it alongside complaint volumes and resolution times to target root-cause fixes. Tracked with complaint volume, resolution time, and compensation totals, this indicator provides a balanced view of consumer outcomes and conduct risk. Definitions and concepts: Resolved in the customer’s favor (upheld): final decision grants redress—monetary (refund/compensation/fee reversal) or non-monetary (policy correction, contract change, apology with tangible remedy). Many firms also count partially upheld cases; disclose whether partials are included. Denominator: all complaints closed in the period. Segment results by product, channel, and severtiy to avoid masking problem areas. Data requirements: Central complaint-management records with unique IDs, receipt date, closure date, product, channel, allegation type, decision outcome (upheld/partially/declined), and compensation amount. Deduplication logic across channels; linkages to ombudsman/regulator portals for escalations and reversals. Customer-base denominator (for intensity metrics) and service level agreement (SLA) timestamps for parallel monitoring* (see note below). Limitations and considerations: Classification discretion: definitions of “partial uphold” vary; publish inclusion rules. Case mix effects: a surge in low-merit mass claims can depress the percentage; report severity-adjusted or line-of-business cuts. Gaming risk: chasing high uphold rates may encourage paying weak claims; pair with fraud flags, root-cause fixes, and cost-per-case. Timing bias: complex cases close later and differ in uphold propensity; use rolling averages and track median resolution time. External outcomes: include overturned-on-appeal adjustments to reflect true customer outcome. *With granular time-stamped complaints data, timeliness of key milestones in the complaints resolution process can be tracked, for example time to acknowledge complaint, time to first response, time to resolution. With this data, supervisors can track not just outcomes, but also whether providers are meeting required timeframes per their own SLA.

171,114,Unsecured credit facilities per borrower,Average volume and value (outstanding amount) of unsecured credit operations per borrower,"This indicator shows, for each unsecured credit type (e.g., credit cards, personal instalment loans, overdrafts/lines, BNPL/pay-in-4, microcredit), how many active facilities the typical borrower holds (volume) and how much they owe on average (value). It reveals product stacking, utilisation intensity, and pockets of affordability risk. Rising volumes with flat values can indicate product fragmentation (e.g., multiple small BNPL plans), while high values per borrower point to concentration risk and potential loss severity. Definitions and concepts: Borrower universe per type (t): unique customers with ≥1 active unsecured facility of type (t) during the period. Average volume (holders-only) = [Total number of active contracts of type t for borrow b] / [Total number of unique borrowers with facility of type t]. Average value (holders only) = [Average daily outstanding balance across all of borrower b's facility of type t] / [Total number of unique borrowers with facility of type t]. Outstanding amount: Gross carrying amount before prvisions, exclude undrawn limits. Attribution rules: Define treatment of joint borrowers (full vs. proportional), refinances/restructures and charged-off accounts (exclude once written off, unless still on-book). Data requirements: Loan/line-level records with borrower ID, product/credit-type tag, status, origination date, limit (revolving), currency, and daily balances.

Definitions and concepts: Relief measures (forbearance): payment holiday/deferral, interest-only period, reduced instalment, term extension, fee/penalty waiver, capitalization of arrears, hardship programs.Borrower-based indicator: % of borrowers on relief = [Total unique borrowers with at least 1 active relief measure in period]/[Total unique active borrowing customers] x 100%. Account-based variant uses loan count instead of borrowers. Status: Active (relief in effect), Approved but not started, Expired. Intensity companions: % of balances under relief, avg. relief days used, new entrants to relief ÷ active borrowers. Data requirements: Loan-level flags: relief type, start/end dates, approval date, terms (interest accrual, capitalization), reason code (income loss, disaster, medical), product type. Borrower ID (deduplicated across products/entities). Limitations and considerations: Definition variance: some programs auto-enrol; others require hardship evidence—harmful to cross-bank comparisons. Double counting: a borrower may receive multiple reliefs across loans—use borrower-level dedupe and report per-loan as a companion. Masking effect: relief suppresses DPD/NPL temporarily; pair with balances under relief and post-exit performance. Cohort effects & timing: shocks (e.g., disasters) create spikes; use cohort tracking (by approval month) and rolling windows.

190,124,Borrowers in debt counselling and rehabilitation,% of borrowers participating in debt counselling and/or debt rehabilitation progams,"This indicator tracks the prevalence of individuals formally enrolled in debt-counselling or rehabilitation programmes: legal or contractual processes that restructure debt, impose spending plans, or provide financial-literacy support. A rising level signals household over-indebtedness pressures, tighter monetary or labour-market conditions, or aggressive credit expansion in the recent past. Regulators, consumer-protection agencies, and lenders track the metric to gauge systemic consumer-credit risk, calibrate responsible-lending rules and supervision, and anticipate write-off or provisioning needs. Definitions and concepts: Borrowers refers to individuals that have obtained any type of credit from financial institutions. Individuals are counted as one borrower, irrespective of the number of loan accounts held. Debt-counselling / debt-review: A court-sanctioned or regulator-approved process (e.g., South Africa’s National Credit Act, UK Debt Management Plans) where a certified counsellor assesses affordability, negotiates new payment schedules with all creditors, and disburses consolidated instalments. Debt rehabilitation / discharge: The stage at which the borrower has completed the plan, obtained a clearance certificate, or been legally discharged from remaining obligations (analogous to Chapter 13 completion in the US). Indicator forms:
Stock measure: number of active borrowers under counselling ÷ total number of retail borrowers. Flow measure: new counselling entrants during the period ÷ new defaults. Data requirements: Registry or court filings identifying unique borrowers, start and end dates, original and restructured debt balances, and counsellor accreditation. Credit-bureau data to link counselling status with credit scores, delinquency buckets, and new credit enquiries. Limitations and considerations: Coverage gaps: Informal or NGO-led advice services may not report centrally, understating prevalence. Regime differences: Some jurisdictions treat insolvency, debt management, and bankruptcy as separate processes; harmonising counts is non-trivial. Multiple enrolments: Borrowers can exit and re-enter counselling; deduplicating unique individuals is essential for accurate stock figures. Moral-hazard concerns: Easy access to rehabilitation might weaken repayment discipline; analysts pair this indicator with post-rehabilitation re-default rates.Privacy restrictions: Personally identifiable data are often masked, limiting segmentation by income, gender, or geography unless aggregated extracts are provided.

For lenders, rising early payoffs may flag aggressive refinancing campaigns by competitors, interest rate declines that make refinancing attractive, or borrowers’ improved liquidity.

51,164,Retirement income per pension beneficiary,Average pension disbursement per pensioner,"Average pension plan income received by pension beneficiaries. Definitions and concepts: A pension beneficiary is a person who is receiving, or is entitled to receive, a benefit under a pension plan. A pension is the monthly, annual or other periodic amounts that start being paid to a pension plan member at retirement and that continue for the rest of his or her life. The term “pension plans” refers to plans that individuals access via their employer or a financial institution, and in which they accumulate rights or assets.

Individuals or MSMEs are counted as one borrower, irrespective of the number of loan accounts held. Data requirements: Unique borrowers who opened at least one loan account during the most recent specific period (e.g. month, quarter or year.), including borrowers whose loan was subsequently closed at the end of the period. For computing borrowers per capita or percent of adults that borrow from financial institutions, need total adult population (official count from census or estimates from national statistics agency).

Data requirements: Transaction-level granular data identifying the date and value of inflows (e.g. deposits or transfers-in) and outflows (withdrawals or transfers-out). For example, computing average yearly net flows across savings accounts at a commercial bank requires several operations: (1) aggregating all inflows and outflows for the calendar year, by unique account or customer, (2) substracting the difference between total yearly inflows and outflows, yielding the net inflow by year and unique account or customer, and (3) Averaging net inflows by year across all unique accounts or customers yielding the typical net yearly inflow.

26,130,Gender composition of loan guarantors,Gender composition of guarantors in the retail loan portfolio,"Measures the representation of different genders among the individuals who act as loan guarantors--pledge to repay a loan if the borrower defaults. It offers a sophisticated lens through which to view credit risk, gender-based economic disparities, and the social dynamics that underpin a loan portfolio. It can reveal hidden concentration risks. For example, if a large portion of a bank's small business loans are guaranteed by the male spouses of female entrepreneurs, the portfolio's risk profile becomes heavily correlated with the financial health and stability of that specific demographic.  This metric also provides insights into the structural barriers different genders face when seeking credit. If the data shows that female borrowers disproportionately require male guarantors (while the reverse is not true), it can signal underlying biases in credit assessment or a disparity in asset ownership. Prudential supervisors may also be interested in finding out whether the different permutations of borrower's and guarantor's gender could relate to loan performance.

This includes both event-driven acute risks and longer-term chronic risks. This indicator is essential for measuring an insurer's vulnerability to climate-related claims, which can impact its profitability, solvency, and ability to provide affordable coverage. Hence, it is an important metric for prudential supervisors from the perspective of capital adequacy, solvency and risk management.

122,153,Cost of reinsurance,Premiums ceded to reinsurers as % of gross premium written,"The cost of reinsurance indicator quantifies the price an insurer pays to transfer part of its underwriting risk to reinsurers. Tracked as either an absolute expense or as a ratio—most often Reinsurance premium ceded ÷ Gross premiums written (GPW)—it shows how much earnings capacity the insurer surrenders for balance-sheet protection. Rising costs may stem from hardening global reinsurance markets, high catastrophe exposures, deteriorating loss experience or weakened credit quality of the insurer. Supervisors and rating agencies watch for excessive reliance on expensive reinsurance cover which can compress margins, while under-spending may leave the insurer over-exposed to shocks. Evaluated over time and in tandem with retention ratios, claims ratio and solvency coverage, the cost of reinsurance reveals whether an insurer’s risk transfer strategy is adequate. Definitions and concepts: Reinsurance premium ceded: contractual payments (net of commissions) made to reinsurers for proportional (quota-share, surplus) or non-proportional (excess-of-loss, stop-loss) treaties, booked at treaty inception. Net cost of reinsurance: ceded premium minus ceding commission plus profit-commission adjustments and reinstatement premiums.

114,154,Risk retention ratio (dependency on reinsurance),% of gross written premium that is net (as a measure of the level of dependency on reinsurance),"Also known as the net retention ratio, this indicator shows the proportion of insurance risk an insurer keeps on its own balance sheet after ceding portions to reinsurers. It is usually expressed as Net premiums written ÷ Gross premiums written. A high ratio signals greater self-reliance (and potentially higher earnings volatility), while a low ratio points to heavy dependence on reinsurance, which may reduce earnings swings but create counter-party risks. Supervisors monitor the metric to ensure that ceded volumes are commensurate with the insurer’s capital strength, product mix, and risk appetite. Definitions and concepts: Gross premiums written (GPW): Total premium income before reinsurance ceded. Net premiums written (NPW): GPW minus premiums ceded plus reinsurance recoveries on ceded unearned premiums. Data requirements: Line-of-business breakdown of GPW and NPW for the period.

The number of active e-money accounts helps regulators and policymakers: Distinguish between access and use in digital financial inclusion; monitor customer engagement and service relevance, identify inactive or dormant accounts that may distort headline growth figures, evaluate policy effectiveness in promoting routine digital payment usage. It also supports the monitoring of systemic importance, float velocity, and consumer trust in e-money platforms. High or rising values indicate sustained customer engagement and functional usage of e-money systems.
Low or falling ratios of active to total accounts may signal user dormancy, low transaction frequency, or market saturation. Definitions and concepts: E-money is prepaid value stored electronically, which represents a liability of the e-money issuer (a bank, an e-money institution or any other entity authorised or allowed to issue e-money in the local jurisdiction) and which is denominated in a currency backed by an authority. Data requirements: Total count of unique e-money accounts that recorded at least one customer-initiated transaction (cash-in, cash-out, payment, transfer, etc.) during the reference period, based on: Administrative or supervisory data from licensed e-money issuers and mobile-money operators; Disaggregation variables for segmentation analysis such as by provider type, customer type and other customer-level characteristics such as gender and age.

This includes payment accounts held at banks, non-bank financial institutions, or licensed payment service providers. Captures the actual use and transactional activity of the payment system by individuals and firms, reflecting financial inclusion through usage rather than mere account ownership. It provides a direct measure of the vibrancy and adoption of formal payment mechanisms in the economy. Tracking active payment accounts helps regulators and policymakers: Distinguish between access (ownership) and use (activity), monitor engagement levels across payment channels, identify dormancy trends that may indicate barriers to usage, evaluate policy interventions promoting digital payments, interoperability, or account usage. It also supports systemic monitoring of liquidity patterns, financial inclusion outcomes, and payment ecosystem resilience. Higher or rising values indicate active participation in the formal payments system and strong transaction demand. Low or declining activity ratios may suggest dormant account buildup, limited usability, or barriers to routine transactions (e.g., cost, access, or digital literacy). Definitions and concepts: Payment account: An account used for executing payment transactions and accessing funds on demand. Data requirements: Total count of unique payment accounts that registered at least one financial transaction (deposit, transfer, payment, withdrawal, etc.) during the reference period (e.g. past month, past quarter) based on administrative or supervisory data from banks, e-money issuers, and other licensed payment service providers.

It reflects the aggregate stock of demand deposits—funds that customers can withdraw or transfer on demand without notice. Captures the liquid component of the deposit base within the financial system and serves as a measure of transactional liquidity and customer cash management behavior. It represents one of the core liabilities on financial institutions’ balance sheets and a key indicator of short-term financial system liquidity. The balance of current accounts provides insight into: the liquidity preferences of households and businesses; the scale of funds readily available for payments and transactions, and the structure and stability of the financial sector’s funding base. For supervisors, it informs liquidity monitoring, deposit concentration analysis, and monetary aggregates. Higher values indicate greater liquidity and transaction activity in the financial system. Increases may signal rising deposit mobilization, confidence in banks, or high liquidity preference. Declines could point to withdrawals for investment or consumption, or shifts toward time/savings deposits. Definitions and concepts: Current account: A demand deposit account used primarily for payments and everyday transactions, typically without interest or with minimal interest. Data requirements: Administrative account-level data that can facilitate a sum of all balances in active current accounts at the end of the reference period with customer-level disaggregation variables (such as customer type, age, gender, sub-national administrative area) to facilitate segementation analysis.

Captures the stock of e-money in circulation, serving as an indicator of digital liquidity, trust in electronic value storage, and systemic importance of e-money issuers within the payments landscape. The total e-money float helps supervisors monitor: System-wide liquidity exposure of e-money issuers, customer fund safeguarding and segregation compliance, the role of e-money in monetary aggregates and financial stability. It is also a key input to assessing digital financial inclusion and payment ecosystem growth. Higher balances indicate increased usage and confidence in e-money as a store of value. Rapid increases may reflect accelerating digital adoption or limited conversion to cash; Declines could signal withdrawals or regulatory tightening.

87,103,Loans (borrowers),Number of borrowers,"An aggregate measure of uptake of credit (loans) from financial institutions. When expressed as a share of the population, or in per capita terms, it is a measure of the prevalence of borrowing. Definitions and concepts: Borrowers refers to resident individuals or MSMEs that have obtained any type of credit from financial institutions. Individuals or MSMEs are counted as one borrower, irrespective of the number of loan accounts held. Data requirements: Unique borrowers with an open loan account at the end of a specific period (e.g. month, quarter or year.); For computing borrowers per capita or percent of adults that borrow from financial institutions, need total adult population (official count from census or estimates from national statistics agency). Limitations and considerations: If individuals are using loans from multiple financial institutions,  sector or system-wide aggregates, may count the same borrower more than once and therefore overstate the number of unique borrowers unless a unique national ID can be used to track individual borrowers across institutions. Additional requirements and/or operations for key disaggregations:  (A) By type of credit: For each unique borrower, a list of open loan accounts  at the end of a specific period (e.g. month, quarter or year). From this list, obtain the number of open loan accounts for each mutually exclusive credit type category relevant to the local context  (e.g. mortgage, credit card, personal loan, other revolving credit, etc), with a 0 if loan from category is not in use. The percentage of borrowers using at least one loan account for each credit category can then be computed.  (B) By loan size: The objective here is to assign all unique borrowers to a reduced set of loan size categories, for example the percentage of borrowers with loan sizes between (a) 0-10 USD, (b) 10-50 USD, (c) 50-100 USD, (d) 100-1000 USD, (e) 1000+ USD. Granular data or data system that can produce (1) A list of all active unique loans disbursed during a specific period of time, detailing the size (in currency units) of the loan disbursed, (2) Loan-level data should be linkable to a unique customer ID in order to examine all the loans that are currently active per borrower. The loan-level list can be aggregated to a borrower-level list by computing the average loan size per borrower; (C) By interest rate bands: This segmentations provides a summary of the distribution of borrowers by the interest rates attached to their loans, for a specific financial institution or the wider financial system, and require granular data or data system to produce: (1) A list of all active unique loans disbursed during a specific period of time, detailing the  interest rate (APR), (2) Loan-level data should be linkable to a unique customer ID in order to identify all the loans that are currently active per borrower. The loan-level list can be aggregated to a borrower-level list by computing the average APR per borrower (potentially using a weighted average using the loan size as the weight); (D) By credit type: This segmentation can provide measures of the relative prevalence of usage of broad credit types in the financial system.  This segmentation requires that for each unique borrower, a list of open loan accounts  at the end of a specific period (e.g. month, quarter or year) with additional detail available on the number of open loan accounts for each mutually exclusive credit type category relevant to the local context  (e.g. mortgage, credit card, personal loan, other revolving credit, etc), with a 0 if loan from category is not in use.

This includes all forms of insurance other than life insurance, such as motor, property, health, travel, fire, marine, and liability insurance. Captures the depth and reach of risk protection provided by the non-life insurance market, serving as a measure of both market development and household or business financial resilience to unexpected shocks. The number of non-life insurance policies reflects the extent to which households and firms are insured against everyday risks (e.g., accidents, property damage, medical emergencies). For regulators, it indicates: The penetration and diversification of the non-life insurance market; the distribution of insurance coverage across sectors and population groups and the potential exposure of the uninsured to catastrophic losses. Higher values indicate greater risk coverage and insurance market depth, while stagnation or decline may suggest low affordability, weak market development, or limited consumer trust in insurance products. Definitions and concepts: Non-life (general) insurance: Covers financial losses from events other than death, typically over a one-year term. It provides indemnity rather than a savings component, distinguishing it from life insurance. Data requirements: Total count of active non-life insurance policies recorded by licensed insurers at the end of the reporting period, derived from: Administrative data from licensed non-life insurance companies; disaggregation variables for segmentation analysis such as by type of product (vehicle, property, health, etc.), customer segment (individual, SME), and sub-national administrative areas.

Each person is counted once, regardless of the number of pension accounts held. Captures the coverage of the pension system, reflecting the proportion of the population that is formally saving for retirement and protected against income insecurity in old age. Pension account ownership is a key indicator of long-term financial resilience and social protection. It helps regulators and policymakers assess: The inclusiveness and reach of retirement savings systems, the adequacy of long-term savings behavior among workers and the effectiveness of mandatory and voluntary pension schemes in extending coverage. Higher values indicate broader pension system coverage and improved financial preparedness for retirement. Low or stagnant values suggest gaps in coverage, particularly for informal or self-employed workers.

This may include multiple accounts per individual (e.g., when contributors have changed employers or pension schemes). Measures the extent and structure of pension account activity within the system, indicating the depth of retirement savings participation and potential fragmentation across schemes. Tracking the number of pension accounts helps supervisors and policymakers: Monitor system expansion and administrative efficiency, detect duplicate or dormant accounts across multiple schemes, and assess the integration of record-keeping systems and the portability of retirement savings. A higher number of accounts can signal broad participation, but if it grows faster than the number of holders, it may indicate system fragmentation or low account consolidation.

Each customer is counted once, regardless of the number of accounts they maintain. Captures the breadth of participation in savings and deposit services, reflecting the extent to which people and firms are integrated into the formal financial system and engaged in savings and asset accumulation. Savings account ownership is a foundational indicator of financial inclusion and resilience. It signals: The ability of individuals to store value securely, access to interest-bearing or transactional saving mechanisms, and the potential for mobilizing domestic savings to finance investment. For regulators, it provides a measure of deposit market depth, customer outreach, and trust in formal institutions. Higher values indicate broader access to formal savings mechanisms; low values may reveal financial exclusion or preference for informal saving channels. Definitions and concepts: Savings account: A deposit account designed primarily for storing funds and earning interest, typically with withdrawal or transaction limits.

Each depositor is counted once, regardless of the number of term deposit accounts they maintain. Captures the extent of participation in time-bound savings and investment products, reflecting the level of household and business engagement in medium- to long-term saving and wealth accumulation through the formal financial system. Term deposit ownership provides insight into: Household and institutional saving behavior and willingness to commit funds for fixed terms, the structure and stability of financial sector funding, and
the development of interest-bearing savings products and deposit market maturity. For regulators, this indicator helps assess the composition of the deposit base and its contribution to liquidity management and financial stability. Higher values indicate broader participation in structured saving instruments and greater deposit stability; low values may point to limited long-term saving capacity or low product penetration. Definitions and concepts: Term (fixed) deposit: A deposit held for a pre-agreed term that earns interest but typically cannot be withdrawn before maturity without penalty. Maturity term: The period for which the deposit is contracted before it can be withdrawn without penalty.

At a system level it acts as a proxy for financial inclusion and the depth of retail intermediation: more accounts usually mean broader access to formal payments, savings, and safety nets. Sudden growth may signal successful inclusion policies—or, alternatively, aggressive promotional campaigns that inflate dormant or low-balance accounts. Contractions can foreshadow confidence losses, digital-wallet substitution, or macro-economic stress. Definitions and concepts: Deposit accounts are any liability account accepting customer funds repayable on demand or at maturity, protected (wholly or partly) by deposit insurance, they include transaction and non-transaction deposit accounts, for example: Checking/demand, savings, time/term deposit accounts, pensions.

Definitions and concepts: E-money is prepaid value stored electronically, which represents a liability of the e-money issuer (a bank, an e-money institution or any other entity authorised or allowed to issue e-money in the local jurisdiction) and which is denominated in a currency backed by an authority. Data requirements: Total e-money accounts at the end of a specified period (e.g. quarter, or year), based on supervisory data from licensed e-money issuers; Total adult population (counts from recent census or estimates from national statistics agency).  Limitations and considerations: If individuals or MSMEs have multple e-money accounts from the same institution or from multiple different financial institutions, sector or system wide aggregates which add up the number of e-money accounts across institutions can result in an e-money accounts-to-population ratio that exceeds 1.

283,85,E-money account holders,Number of customers holding an e-money account,"Measures the number of individuals or entities that hold at least one active e-money account issued by a licensed e-money issuer or payment service provider during the reporting period. Each holder is counted once, regardless of the number of accounts held. When expressed in per capita terms, it measures the prevalence of uptake in a population and facilitates cross-country comparisons. E-money account ownership is a key measure of financial inclusion and digital payment adoption. It reflects the extent of access to non-bank payment systems, the ability of individuals to store and transfer value electronically, and the growth of digital financial ecosystems supporting low-cost, real-time transactions.
For regulators, it helps monitor non-bank financial intermediation, consumer protection, and systemic importance of e-money providers. Higher values indicate broader participation in digital payments; low values suggest access or adoption barriers, such as digital literacy or connectivity constraints. Definitions and concepts: E-money is prepaid value stored electronically, which represents a liability of the e-money issuer (a bank, an e-money institution or any other entity authorised or allowed to issue e-money in the local jurisdiction) and which is denominated in a currency backed by an authority. Data requirements: Administrative or supervisory data from licensed e-money issuers and mobile-money operators.

144,80,Cost of remittances,Average cost of receiving and sending remittances,"Remittances are an important source of external financing in many countries around the world and support the well-being of migrant families as well as broader development as remittances provide greater opportunities, for savings, consumption and investment. Lowering the transaction costs of remittances matters because it means greater savings for remitters or more income for receiving family members. This indicator measures the financial cost of sending and receiving remittances using the country's financial insfrastructure and can be benchmarked against international averages, for example using the World Bank's remittance prices worldwide reports (https://remittanceprices.worldbank.org). Definitions and concepts: Money remittances are payment services where funds are received from a payer, without any payment accounts being created in the name of the payer or the payee, for the sole purpose of transferring a corresponding amount to a payee or to another institution offering payment services that is acting on behalf of the payee, and/or where such funds are received on behalf of and made available to the payee. These could be inflow transactions into an account, but many remittances will not land into accounts, but rather be withdrawn in cash via a money remitter, a mobile money agent or a bank branch. See for example the Committe on Payment and Settlement Systems red book: https://www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d144.pdf. Data requirements: This indicator can be constructed using current listed prices or data already being reported to regulators to identify, for example, the cost of sending and receiving USD 200 by for each remittance service provider type (Bank, Money transfer operators, Mobile money operators, Post Offices) and for a specified set of remittance corridors that make up the dominant share of remittance corrditors. A simple average can be used (e.g. the average cost of sending 200 USD across all regulated banks) or weighting the listed prices by the volume or value of transactions flowing through each corridor if that data is available by reporting institution. Alternatively, this indicators can be constructed using transaction-level data to identify all remittance transactions made by customers that have been executed during a specific period of time, and taking an overall average or a weighted average by remittance corridor .

A higher share signals stronger inclusion and fewer barriers to entry for low-income or newly banked customers. It also benchmarks market competitiveness and the effectiveness of policy nudges (fee caps, basic-account mandates). Definitions and concepts: Provider: a licensed bank or regulated deposit-taking institution (count each legal entity once; brand-level cuts optional). Qualifying product: a demand/current or other payment-capable deposit account that (a) has no required minimum balance to open or maintain, and (b) does not levy any fee or penalty for falling below any balance threshold (unconditional—no “waived if direct deposit” clauses). Metric: [# of providers with at least 1 qualifying product] / [# of providers offering retail transaction accounts] x 100%. Companion indicators: product-based share (% of products that quality) and coverage share (% of active custoemrs eligible for a zero-minimum product at their provider). Data requirements: Public product disclosures and fee schedules (account opening requirements, minimum-balance rules, below-minimum penalties, waiver conditions). Product taxonomy (basic/no-frills, standard, premium, student/youth, SME). Provider registry (licensed DTIs) to define the denominator. Optional: account-holder counts per provider to compute customer coverage. Limitations and considerations: Conditional waivers: “no fee if direct deposit/average balance ≥ X” do not qualify—document this to avoid overstatement. Promotional periods: temporary fee holidays should be excluded or footnoted.

Overlaying the geographic distribution accountholders on the geographic distribution of physical access points (e.g. branches, ATMs, agents, POS) can help identify locations with deficits in transaction infrastructure. Definitions and concepts: Deposit and payment accounts are broadly defined as an account held with a bank or other authorised and/or regulated service provider (including a non-bank) which can be used to make and receive payments. Payment accounts can be further differentiated into deposit e-money accounts, including mobile money account and other payment accounts. An account holder is a unique individual or MSME that has at least one deposit or payment account. An individual or MSME must be counted as one account holder irrespective of the number of accounts held. Data requirements: (1) List of account holders geo-located to their residence at a primary or secondary subnational administrative area, (2) Number of cash-in/cash-out financial access points for each administrative unit at the selected sub-national level, (3) Total adult population (or surface area) for each administative unit at the selected sub-national level. This indicator requires first computing the density of physical access points per subnational area in per-capita or km2 terms and defining a threshold below which the area is considered to have a low density of access points. The percentage of account holders in subnational areas at or below the density threshold can then be computed. ",individual and MSME,no,volume,"Are there gender disparities in the likelihood of being located in areas with low levels of access to transaction points, including for elderly customers, low-income customers, low-value accounts, and MSMEs based on the ownership gender?

Persistent debt burdens signal predatory lending or inadequate affordability assessments. The indicator helps calibrate market-conduct supervision and regulation. This particular indicator that identifies borrowers at risk of overindebtedness was developed by the Central Bank of Brazil: https://www.bcb.gov.br/content/cidadaniafinanceira/documentos_cidadania/serie_cidadania/serie_cidadania_financeira_8_endividamento_risco_2ed.pdf ad https://www.researchgate.net/publication/376634051_Risky_Indebtedness_Behavior_Impacts_on_Financial_Preparation_for_Retirement_and_Perceived_Financial_Well-Being. It is a composite of four components. A borrower is flagged as being in ""risky indebtedness"" when any two of the following four criteria are met: (1) Has defaulted on credit installments, that is, has had payment delays of more than 90 days in meeting credit obligations, (2) Monthly income devoted to debt-service payments exceeds 50 percent, (3) Has simultaneous exposure to the following forms of credit: overdraft, unsecured personal loan, and revolving credit card debt, (4) Monthly disposable income (after debt-service payments) that falls below the poverty line.

181,128,Revenue generated by unsecured credit,% of total topline revenue attributable to unsecured credit operations and interest and non-interest revenue proportions,"This indicator captures the total income that a lending institution earns from unsecured credit products—credit cards, personal instalment loans, overdrafts, payday and buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) facilities—over a reporting period. Because unsecured lending is typically high-yield and high-risk, tracking its revenue helps supervisors and management understand how much of the institution’s top line depends on products that are more sensitive to economic downturns, job-market shocks and aggressive competition. A rising share can boost short-term profitability, but it may also presage higher future credit losses and conduct-risk concerns if underwriting standards slip. Definitions and concepts: Unsecured credit – loans that are not backed by collateral; repayment relies on the borrower’s cash flow and creditworthiness.
Revenue components – Interest income (accrued and collected) from outstanding balances. Fee income: annual fees, origination fees, late-payment charges, interchange on card transactions, BNPL merchant discount rates. Net insurance or payment-protection premiums (if bundled) may be included subject to local accounting rules.
Revenue share metric: Unsecured-credit revenue ÷ Total lending revenue expresses concentration risk. Risk-adjusted yield – revenue net of credit-loss provisions gives a clearer view of economic profitability. Data requirements: Product-level general-ledger extracts segregating interest, fees and other income. Loan-level flags identifying collateral status (secured vs. unsecured). Average daily or month-end balances to compute effective yields. Associated credit-loss provisions and write-offs for risk-adjusted analysis. Limitations and considerations: Mixed products: Some personal loans are partially secured (e.g., salary-linked) or carry optional collateral; clear taxonomy is essential. Fee recognition rules: Capitalised origination fees amortised under effective-interest-rate (EIR) accounting may blur timing comparisons across banks or jurisdictions. Regulatory caps: Interest-rate or fee ceilings (e.g., usury limits) affect revenue potential and comparability. Promotional pricing: Introductory 0 % card offers or BNPL “pay-in-4” models generate deferred revenue; headline figures may understate future income.

235,187,Consents for sharing data with third-parties ,"% of customers who have given explicit consent for their data to be shared by FSPs with third parties, for various purposes","This indicator shows how many customers have actively opted in to let a financial service provider (FSP) share their data with external parties—for open-banking/aggregation, credit scoring, fraud prevention, marketing, analytics, etc. A higher share can reflect strong digital adoption and trust; low or falling rates may signal poor consent UX, unclear value propositions, or privacy concerns. It helps compliance teams evidence lawfulness, product teams gauge partner-integration reach, and supervisors assess the maturity of consent-based data-sharing ecosystems. Definitions and concepts: Explicit consent: a clear, affirmative action (e.g., checked box, strong-customer-authenticated authorization) tied to a specific purpose, with intelligible notice and the ability to withdraw at any time. Active consent: consent that is valid as of the reference date (not expired, not withdrawn, not superseded). Purpose taxonomy: e.g., account information services (AIS), payment initiation services (PIS), credit decisioning/bureau pulls, fraud/AML tools, personalised marketing, data portability. Metric: % of customer with active consent for purpose p = [# of unique customers with at least 1 active consent for p / # of active customers] x 100%. Indicator companions: Any-purpose consent, consents per consenting customer and revocation rate. Data requirements: Consent ledger that includes: customer ID, purpose(s) granted, third-party identity, channel, timestamp, expiry/refresh cycle, version of the privacy notice, proof of consent (hash, audit trail, SCA event). Status events: withdrawals, expiries, scope changes, third-party disconnects. Reference universe: deduplicated active-customer list (define “active”: e.g., ≥1 product in force or ≥1 login/transaction in last 12 months). Limitations and considerations: Granularity & fragmentation: a customer may consent per app, per account, and per purpose; avoid double counting by using unique customers and report purpose-level cuts. Expiry & refresh: open-banking tokens often have short authorizations; snapshot dates vs. rolling windows will yield different figures—disclose method.

45,166,Crowdfunding - Differential rate of return (equity),Difference between the advertised/promised rate of return and the actual rate of return of equity in crowdfunding projects,"Measures the gap between the projected or advertised rate of return presented to investors before a project is funded and the actual rate of return realized after the project is completed. This is a critical conduct indicator that measures the accuracy of a project's promises versus its real-world performance. For investors, this metric is a tool for due diligence. For conduct supervisors, it can be used to detect mis-selling and fraud. A large and persistent negative differential (where actual returns are consistently far below promised returns) is a red flag. it could flag issues such as inadequate risk disclosure and fraud. When gender disaggregated by the gender of the main sponsor or lead executive, the indicator can provide additional information. If projects led by women consistently show a smaller negative ""reality gap"" (meaning their actual returns are closer to their promised returns), it could suggest they are more conservative or accurate in their financial projections. This would be a crucial data point in assessing risk and investor protection. Using this indicator together with the indicator on rejected crowddfunding projects could strenghten the identification of gender bias inside the securities authority.
