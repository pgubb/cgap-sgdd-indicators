RGDD explorer is an interactive catalog of indicators to help financial sector authorities 
understand and identify how regulatory data can be used for gender disaggregated analysis. The RGDD explorer is part of CGAP's Supply-side Gender Disaggregated Data in the Financial sector project, 
where the goal is to develop technical guidance for financial regulators and supervisors to help mainstream the collection and use of financial supply-side gender-disaggregated data (S-GDD) 
to support womenâ€™s inclusion in and participation to the financial sector (both as customers and as staff) in effective and impactful ways.
